site seatching.»Based upon my training and experience, the examination of such devices can be a
time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or
