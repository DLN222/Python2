site seatching.»Based upon my training and experience, the examination of such devices can be a
time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

Case No.

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”

Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Page 15 of 16

## Page 16

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting

testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand

and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S

STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

12 Without getting into the factual assertions you

14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

10 We have already provided defense counsel with all
11 the discovery in the case that is not included within the

13 THE COURT: With»xespectitojstatements'made"by the
14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.
18 MR. SAVINO: We have not, Judge.
19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail
24 returns by each person. It would just be all the e-mails
25 included in those accounts.
