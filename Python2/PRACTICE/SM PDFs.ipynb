      "During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and\n",
      "\n",
      "my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and\n",
      "sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated\n",
      "in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and\n",
      "prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical\n",
      "surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to\n",
      "secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods\n",
      "and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,\n",
      "cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal\n",
      "activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by\n",

      "crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution\n",
