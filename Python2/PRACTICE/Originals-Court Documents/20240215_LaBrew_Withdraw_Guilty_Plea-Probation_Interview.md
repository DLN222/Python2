COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

AFFIRMATION &
MEMORANDUM OF
LAW IN RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT'S
MOTION TO
WITHDRAW GUILTY
PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You do however retain certain

appellate rights. So, for example, if any sentence I

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

to execute the Waiver of Appeal or the plea agreement, you

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

understand?

Yes.

THE DEFENDANT:

THE COURT: All right.

Do you also understand that while you are

incarcerated, your right to vote in any city, state or

federal election will be suspended?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And it will be restored to you
immediately upon your release, understood?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right.

Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how you might
defend against the charges in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And both sides agree that Mr. McEnaney

is not a predicate felon?

MR. SAVINO: Correct.

THE COURT: All right.

So the promised sentence in this case is four

months jail concurrent with five years probation subject to

the Waiver of Appeal and specific allocution. Have any

other promises been made to you?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

THE COURT: Do the People have any objection to an
adjournment for after the holidays?

MR. SAVINO: No, Judge.
THE COURT: All right. Then let's figure out a

date. How is January 11?

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and

AFFIRMATION &
MEMORANDUM OF
LAW IN RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT'S
MOTION TO
WITHDRAW GUILTY
PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Z


## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God or so
you affirm?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: State your full name for the record,
please.

THE DEFENDANT: Stephen E. McEnaney.

THE COURT: Mr. McEnaney, listen to me carefully.

I will be asking you a series of questions. If at any time

you don't understand me, let me know, and if you need to
have time to speak to your attorney, I'm happy to let you
do that, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, for the record, is Mr. Richard
Southard who is seated next to you your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have you had enough time to fully
discuss your plea and sentence with your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the
representation you have received from him?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And are you pleading guilty to this

THE COURT: Has anyone forced or threatened you to
plead guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: Are you on any drugs, medication or
alcohol today?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: So you fully understand what is
happening here, correct?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: When you plead guilty, you give up
certain valuable constitutional rights including but not

limited to the right to remain silent, the right toa

trial, the right to confront the witnesses who testify

against you at trial, to require the People to prove your
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to testify on your own
behalf and call witnesses on your own behalf, if that's
what you choose to do, as well as the right to contest any
search or seizure which may have occurred in this case. Do
you willingly and voluntarily give up each of those
valuable rights?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, People, is there a Certificate of
Compliance in the case?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

discovery?

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You do however retain certain

appellate rights. So, for example, if any sentence I

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

to execute the Waiver of Appeal or the plea agreement, you

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

understand?

Yes.

THE DEFENDANT:

THE COURT: All right.

Do you also understand that while you are

incarcerated, your right to vote in any city, state or

federal election will be suspended?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And it will be restored to you
immediately upon your release, understood?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right.

Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how you might
defend against the charges in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And both sides agree that Mr. McEnaney

is not a predicate felon?

MR. SAVINO: Correct.

the Waiver of Appeal and specific allocution. Have any

other promises been made to you?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

THE COURT: Do the People have any objection to an
adjournment for after the holidays?

MR. SAVINO: No, Judge.
THE COURT: All right. Then let's figure out a

date. How is January 11?

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

Proceedings 12

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and
