NOTICE OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES! 62 MAR 0.9 2929

If you are not a United States citizen, a plea of guilty to any offense, a conviction by trial verdict, or a youthful
offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «
