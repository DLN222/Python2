STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).
