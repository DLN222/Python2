THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”
People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005).

Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

d. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witnesses have given statements that are or may be contradictory to each other;

charged or indicating a failure on the part of any potential witness to identify the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime(s) charged;

f. Any information indicating that any prospective prosecution witness, has or had a history of
mental or emotional disturbance;

g. Full disclosure of any consideration, promise of consideration, or expectation of consideration

witness's testimony;

unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the
probationary, parole, or custodial status of the witness, or any other pending or potential legal disputes

perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,
accomplice, or co-conspirator has testified before any court or grand jury, including date, caption, and

1. Any lack of qualification by any person performing any scientific test in connection with this

matter;
m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

1 provide summaries once we figure out what can be disclosed.
2 THE COURT: That should be done as expeditiously as
8 possible.
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.
5 THE COURT: And briefly, for the record, state the
6 basis for your belief that you have established the necessary
7 standard for withholding the other information until the
8 start of jury selection.
9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received
2 from this prostitution organization; voluminous phone

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”

argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a

not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the

52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

## Page 16

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
Il. DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting

testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

il. BRADY

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

1. Any lack of qualification by any person performing any scientific test in connection with this

matter;
m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

»Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

2 information and materials be kept in defense counsel's sole

3 possession and not copied, disclosed or disseminated. We are

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

i) in the presence of defense counsel and not copy, photograph

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

10 We have already provided defense counsel with all
11 the discovery in the case that is not included within the
12 Protective Order. I would like to file and serve a copy.
13 THE COURT: With»xespectitojstatements'made"by the
14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.
18 MR. SAVINO: We have not, Judge.
19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail
24 returns by each person. It would just be all the e-mails
25 included in those accounts.

S made statements that would be discoverable?
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes.
5 THE COURT: And have you provided those statements

7 MR. SAVINO: Not yet.
8 THE COURT: And those are part of the materials

10 MR. SAVINO: Correct.
11 THE COURT: And why could the substance of those

i MR. SAVINO: A limited summary of that could be
15 turned over. I did not want to do that until we actually had

17 year ago. So, it's just been between the different Judges.

2 THE COURT: That should be done as expeditiously as
8 possible.
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.
5 THE COURT: And briefly, for the record, state the
6 basis for your belief that you have established the necessary
7 standard for withholding the other information until the
8 start of jury selection.
9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received
2 from this prostitution organization; voluminous phone

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

When I had first taken over the case, since the

asked if Your Honor would consider probation. You said you
hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

there might be a statute of limitations issue related to the case. I asked Mr. Southard
several times, on numerous occasions, how could I be accused of something that

District Attorney, and the Judge. I had previously told Mr. Southard that I wanted to be
present at all proceedings regarding my case, Mr. Southard did not have my permission to

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

District Attorney told him that the statue of limitations had expired for Mr. DiMenna and
not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to
contact, and the few times that we did speak about the case, the conversations were not
productive. I never fully understood what was happening in my casc. He just kept telling
me that the Judge hates me and wants to put me in jail. ] have attached a couple of e-

To: Richard Southard <southardlaw@gmail.com>

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
NEW YORK COUNTY: CRIMINAL TERM PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”

argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

d. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witnesses have given statements that are or may be contradictory to each other;

charged or indicating a failure on the part of any potential witness to identify the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime(s) charged;

f. Any information indicating that any prospective prosecution witness, has or had a history of
mental or emotional disturbance;

g. Full disclosure of any consideration, promise of consideration, or expectation of consideration

witness's testimony;

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and
unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the

perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,

matter;
m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

People v, O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

at this time.

- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot

Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

Indictment No. 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant
I, Lawrence P. LaBrew, an attorney admitted to practice in all New York State Courts, do
hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2106, that the following
facts are true:
L. I am not a party to the action, and I am over 18 years of age. My office is located at 30
Wall Street 8" Floor, New York, New York 10005.
2s I am the attorney for Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. On2 February 2024, at 7:45 p.m., I served the Defendant's Motion to Withdraw his Plea
of Guilty, with the attached Exhibits, on the New York County District Attorney’s Office.

indictment Number 70297-2022 AL TERM (EDDS 01/08/2024 03:14 PI

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in
criminal cases’” ( People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, Iv denied 82 NY2d 717, quoting
Hill v Lockhart, 474 US 52, 56, quoting McMann y Richardson, 397 US 759, 771).”).

Appellate Division in another Department until such time as this Court or the
Court of Appeals passes on the question (l Carmody-Wait 2d, NY Prac § 2:63, at

9. Counsel was recently retained, and Counsel just Teceived the Defendant’s file — With
discovery — ftom the Prior attorney on Thursday, 4 January 2024: it Consists of a hard

CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d), and that the Defendant Tequires a reasonable amount of time to

PROC. LAW § 220,60 (3).

WHEREF ORE, the Defense Tespectfully requests that the Court allow the substitution of
4 Counsel, and that Counsel be allowed 4 reasonable amount of time to file a motion to withdraw

the Defendants’ guilty plea, and that the Court grant any other relief that it deems just, proper,
