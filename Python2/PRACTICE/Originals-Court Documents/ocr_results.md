THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”
People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005).

Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

d. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witnesses have given statements that are or may be contradictory to each other;

charged or indicating a failure on the part of any potential witness to identify the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime(s) charged;

f. Any information indicating that any prospective prosecution witness, has or had a history of
mental or emotional disturbance;

g. Full disclosure of any consideration, promise of consideration, or expectation of consideration

witness's testimony;

unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the
probationary, parole, or custodial status of the witness, or any other pending or potential legal disputes

perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,
accomplice, or co-conspirator has testified before any court or grand jury, including date, caption, and

1. Any lack of qualification by any person performing any scientific test in connection with this

matter;
m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

1 provide summaries once we figure out what can be disclosed.
2 THE COURT: That should be done as expeditiously as
8 possible.
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.
5 THE COURT: And briefly, for the record, state the
6 basis for your belief that you have established the necessary
7 standard for withholding the other information until the
8 start of jury selection.
9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received
2 from this prostitution organization; voluminous phone

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted
physicalisurveillanceiof the TARGET PREMISES. At approximately 1035 hours, I observed
a 2013 White Ford C-Max with New York license plate KPR5958, The car was operated by a

white male wearing glasses, who turned onto Molly’s Way in the direction of the gated
driveway entrance to 22 Mollys Way.

i. The White Ford C-Max with license plate KPR5958 is registered

to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

site seatching.»Based upon my training and experience, the examination of such devices can be a
time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the

to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

Case No.

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”
People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005).

8. See also People v. Casey, 149 A.D.3d 771, 50 N.Y.S.3d 528 (2™ Dept. 2017), People v.
Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Page 15 of 16

## Page 16

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

3 possession and not copied, disclosed or disseminated. We are

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

i) in the presence of defense counsel and not copy, photograph

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

10 We have already provided defense counsel with all
11 the discovery in the case that is not included within the

14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.

19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail

25 included in those accounts.

8 THE COURT: And those are part of the materials

4 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.
5 THE COURT: And briefly, for the record, state the
6 basis for your belief that you have established the necessary
7 standard for withholding the other information until the
8 start of jury selection.
9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

MR. SOUTHARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: So, May 4th to review discovery
compliance. Be here at 9:30 and I will have you out by 9:40.

MR. SOUTHARD: One more matter.

When I had first taken over the case, since the
People have not made any offer in the case whatsoever, I
asked if Your Honor would consider probation. You said you
hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

THE COURT: So, this appears to be an E Felony.

MR. SAVINO: D Felony.

THE COURT: All right.

there might be a statute of limitations issue related to the case. I asked Mr. Southard

District Attorney, and the Judge. I had previously told Mr. Southard that I wanted to be
present at all proceedings regarding my case, Mr. Southard did not have my permission to

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

District Attorney told him that the statue of limitations had expired for Mr. DiMenna and
not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to

To: Richard Southard <southardlaw@gmail.com>

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

ADDENDUM TO ATTORNEY
AFFIDAVIT REGARDING NEW
RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

reports, UF61 or other complaint reports, pre-arraignment forms, aided reports, supervisor’s reports,
Unusual Occurrence Reports, Evidence Collection Unit Reports, Stop and Frisk Reports, OLBS
Worksheets, Police Service Request cards, complaint follow-ups, Stop and Frisk Reports, on-line
booking sheets, precinct log book entries and handwritten and typed notes of any officer participating
in the investigation leading to defendant’s indictment;

c. the exact time and manner by which a law enforcement official was first alerted to the incident
which resulted in the defendant’s arrest;

d. tape recordings, complaint logs, and transcripts relating to any "911" call or call to the police
relating to the crime charged;

d. tape recordings, dispatcher logs, transcripts or memoranda recording any police
communications during the investigation of the crime charged, including but not limited to, a check of
defendant’s drivers license, license plates, vehicle and of the seized weapon;

e. any notes made by police officials concerning their investigation, whether to be used at trial or
not;

f. any grand jury referral forms;

g. any portion of any police department manual, directive, or policy statement governing the police
conduct of this investigation in any respect;

h. diagrams, charts or other intended to be used at trial by prosecution witnesses or by the
prosecutor

i. any signatures or writing samples taken of defendant during the booking process;

j. any written waiver or any evidence of any evidence of waiver alleged by the People to have been
made by defendant concerning any statutory or Constitutional rights.

k. any radio communications relating to the observation of defendant, his conduct, or relating to
defendant's arrest in general.

15. An itemized description of any property recovered or seized during the investigation of the
charges, the person or place from which the property was taken, the person effecting such seizure or

receiving the property, the date or dates the property was seized or recovered, and whether such seizure


## Page 8

was pursuant to a warrant;

16. Any records or documents, including handwritten notes, relating to any test or analysis

performed on any physical evidence or sample seized.

17. The name and field of expertise of each person that the People intend to call at trial as an expert
witness, as well as:

a. the field and subject matter of the expert's expected testimony;

b. a copy of the resume or curriculum vitae of the expert;

c. for each scientific examination or test performed, the name, author, and chapter of any reference
manual or authoritative text referred to or relied upon;

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen

General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the
defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE
8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who
previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE


## Page 5

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

Complai babl istedmtombeli heedefendant’s»pri
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012

While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant

to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient

residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.



## Page 6

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the

defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).
‘ PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
i DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

Lo

thereof of every alibi witness upon whom the defendant intends to rely to establish the

defendant’s presence elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.

Wherefore, it is respectfully requested that, except as consented to herein, the

defendant’s motion should be denied.

MOTION TO
WITHDRAW GUILTY
PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Z


## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

Sati Singh, RPR

Proceedings 3

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

THE COURT: I'm not going to give the three-month

split. I will agree to impose four months concurrent with

Thank you.

comfortable with three months, but would do four months,

five years probation split with a Waiver of Appeal and

specific allocution if he is interested in disposing of the

case today.

MR. SOUTHARD: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: He is. All right.

So, please give me a COpy of the indictment, Mr.

Savino.

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

the signed Waiver of Appeal .

THE COURT: All right.

MR. SAVINO: And I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Then at this time, counsel, does your

client wish to withdraw his previously entered plea of not

guilty, and enter a plea of guilty to the sole count in the

indictment of promoting prostitution in the third degree in

exchange for a promised sentence of four months jail

concurrent with five years probation split, subject to a

Waiver of Appeal and the specific allocution proposed by

the People?

MR. SOUTHARD: He does, your Honor.

you affirm?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: State your full name for the record,

THE DEFENDANT: Stephen E. McEnaney.

THE COURT: Mr. McEnaney, listen to me carefully.

I will be asking you a series of questions. If at any time

you don't understand me, let me know, and if you need to
have time to speak to your attorney, I'm happy to let you
do that, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, for the record, is Mr. Richard
Southard who is seated next to you your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have you had enough time to fully
discuss your plea and sentence with your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the
representation you have received from him?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And are you pleading guilty to this
charge because you are in fact guilty?

THE COURT: Has anyone forced or threatened you to
plead guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: Are you on any drugs, medication or
alcohol today?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: So you fully understand what is
happening here, correct?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: When you plead guilty, you give up
certain valuable constitutional rights including but not

limited to the right to remain silent, the right toa

trial, the right to confront the witnesses who testify

against you at trial, to require the People to prove your
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to testify on your own
behalf and call witnesses on your own behalf, if that's
what you choose to do, as well as the right to contest any
search or seizure which may have occurred in this case. Do
you willingly and voluntarily give up each of those
valuable rights?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, People, is there a Certificate of
Compliance in the case?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

Proceedings 12

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and

which resulted in the defendant’s arrest;

d. tape recordings, complaint logs, and transcripts relating to any "911" call or call to the police
relating to the crime charged;

d. tape recordings, dispatcher logs, transcripts or memoranda recording any police
communications during the investigation of the crime charged, including but not limited to, a check of
defendant’s drivers license, license plates, vehicle and of the seized weapon;

e. any notes made by police officials concerning their investigation, whether to be used at trial or
not;

f. any grand jury referral forms;

g. any portion of any police department manual, directive, or policy statement governing the police
conduct of this investigation in any respect;

h. diagrams, charts or other intended to be used at trial by prosecution witnesses or by the
prosecutor

i. any signatures or writing samples taken of defendant during the booking process;

j. any written waiver or any evidence of any evidence of waiver alleged by the People to have been
made by defendant concerning any statutory or Constitutional rights.

k. any radio communications relating to the observation of defendant, his conduct, or relating to
defendant's arrest in general.

15. An itemized description of any property recovered or seized during the investigation of the
charges, the person or place from which the property was taken, the person effecting such seizure or

receiving the property, the date or dates the property was seized or recovered, and whether such seizure


## Page 8

was pursuant to a warrant;

16. Any records or documents, including handwritten notes, relating to any test or analysis

performed on any physical evidence or sample seized.

17. The name and field of expertise of each person that the People intend to call at trial as an expert
witness, as well as:

a. the field and subject matter of the expert's expected testimony;

b. a copy of the resume or curriculum vitae of the expert;

c. for each scientific examination or test performed, the name, author, and chapter of any reference
manual or authoritative text referred to or relied upon;

d. if this expert has previously testified for the People the date, case name, Court, indictment or

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

site seatching.»Based upon my training and experience, the examination of such devices can be a
time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical
requirements of forensic examination, I am aware that searching and seizing information from
such devices often requires police officers to seize most or all such devices along with related
peripherals and software to be seatched later by a qualified person in a laboratory or other

controlled environment.

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”
People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005).

Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not

6 New York, New York. Good morning.
7 THE COURT: Good morning.
8 MR. SAVINO: For the People Keith Savino,
2) SAVINO. Good morning.
10 THE COURT: So, we have before the Court People's
11 Motion for Protective Order.
12 Without getting into the factual assertions you
L3 are seeking to protect, why don't you make a record of the
14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las
15 order.
16 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Your Honor. I will go through a
17 short but detailed account here.
18 So, the People will primarily rely on the motion
Lo papers setting forth fact as arguments under CPL 245.70 sub
20 Ls
21 We are seeking the delay, until commencement of
Ze jury selection, disclosure of the names and contact
29 information and other identifying information of 11 witnesses
24 that will either be called to testify or whose names will
25 appear throughout the trial, in various forms of evidence.

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

2 information and materials be kept in defense counsel's sole

3 possession and not copied, disclosed or disseminated. We are

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

i) in the presence of defense counsel and not copy, photograph

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

2 sites.
10 We have already provided defense counsel with all
11 the discovery in the case that is not included within the
12 Protective Order. I would like to file and serve a copy.
13 THE COURT: With»xespectitojstatements'made"by the
14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.
18 MR. SAVINO: We have not, Judge.
19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail
24 returns by each person. It would just be all the e-mails
25 included in those accounts.

1 THE COURT: Have any of those witnesses whose
2 identities you are seeking to protect until jury selection,
S made statements that would be discoverable?
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes.
5 THE COURT: And have you provided those statements
6 to defense counsel yet?
7 MR. SAVINO: Not yet.
8 THE COURT: And those are part of the materials
, that you are seeking to withhold at this time?
10 MR. SAVINO: Correct.
11 THE COURT: And why could the substance of those
12 statements or testimony not be revealed now, at least to

i MR. SAVINO: A limited summary of that could be
15 turned over. I did not want to do that until we actually had
16 this hearing. I submitted this Protective Order almost a
17 year ago. So, it's just been between the different Judges.
18 THE COURT: I just received it.

2 THE COURT: That should be done as expeditiously as
8 possible.
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.
5 THE COURT: And briefly, for the record, state the
6 basis for your belief that you have established the necessary
7 standard for withholding the other information until the
8 start of jury selection.
9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received
2 from this prostitution organization; voluminous phone

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

When I had first taken over the case, since the

hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

regard to Mr. DiMenna. I was not present when my attorncy met with the Assistant
District Attorney, and the Judge. I had previously told Mr. Southard that I wanted to be
present at all proceedings regarding my case, Mr. Southard did not have my permission to

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

8. l asked Mr. Southard why the statute of limitations had not expired for me, since he said

that the statute of limitations had expired for Mr. DiMenna, and he repeated that the
District Attorney told him that the statue of limitations had expired for Mr. DiMenna and
not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to
contact, and the few times that we did speak about the case, the conversations were not
productive. I never fully understood what was happening in my casc. He just kept telling
me that the Judge hates me and wants to put me in jail. ] have attached a couple of e-

mails that I sent Mr. Southard expressing my concems about my case.

To: Richard Southard <southardlaw@gmail.com>

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

NOTICE OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES! 62 MAR 0.9 2929

If you are not a United States citizen, a plea of guilty to any offense, a conviction by trial verdict, or a youthful
offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Z


## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

Proceedings 2

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

Sati Singh, RPR

Proceedings 3

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

MR. SAVINO: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: Not today, your Honor. He is

interested in the 90-days split and would be prepared to

move forward today on that if your Honor would grant Bo

THE COURT: I'm not going to give the three-month

split. I will agree to impose four months concurrent with

five years probation split then if he takes it today.

Can we have a second call so I may

MR. SOUTHARD:

speak to him on that, Judge?

THE COURT: Yes.

Thank you.

MR. SOUTHARD:

THE CLERK: Recalling number 21 on the calendar in

the matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment number 70297 of

comfortable with three months, but would do four months,

five years probation split with a Waiver of Appeal and

specific allocution if he is interested in disposing of the

case today.

MR. SOUTHARD: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: He is. All right.

So, please give me a COpy of the indictment, Mr.

Savino.

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

the signed Waiver of Appeal .

THE COURT: All right.

MR. SAVINO: And I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Then at this time, counsel, does your

client wish to withdraw his previously entered plea of not

guilty, and enter a plea of guilty to the sole count in the

indictment of promoting prostitution in the third degree in

exchange for a promised sentence of four months jail

concurrent with five years probation split, subject to a

Waiver of Appeal and the specific allocution proposed by

the People?

MR. SOUTHARD: He does, your Honor.

THE COURT:

All right.

Please swear Mr. Mcknaney.

evidence you shall give this Court will be the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God or so
you affirm?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: State your full name for the record,
please.

THE DEFENDANT: Stephen E. McEnaney.

THE COURT: Mr. McEnaney, listen to me carefully.

I will be asking you a series of questions. If at any time

you don't understand me, let me know, and if you need to
have time to speak to your attorney, I'm happy to let you
do that, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, for the record, is Mr. Richard
Southard who is seated next to you your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have you had enough time to fully
discuss your plea and sentence with your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the
representation you have received from him?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And are you pleading guilty to this
charge because you are in fact guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Has anyone forced or threatened you to
plead guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: Are you on any drugs, medication or
alcohol today?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: So you fully understand what is
happening here, correct?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: When you plead guilty, you give up
certain valuable constitutional rights including but not

limited to the right to remain silent, the right toa

trial, the right to confront the witnesses who testify

against you at trial, to require the People to prove your
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to testify on your own
behalf and call witnesses on your own behalf, if that's
what you choose to do, as well as the right to contest any
search or seizure which may have occurred in this case. Do
you willingly and voluntarily give up each of those
valuable rights?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, People, is there a Certificate of
Compliance in the case?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

discovery?

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You do however retain certain

appellate rights. So, for example, if any sentence I

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

to execute the Waiver of Appeal or the plea agreement, you

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

understand?

Yes.

THE DEFENDANT:

THE COURT: All right.

Do you also understand that while you are

incarcerated, your right to vote in any city, state or

federal election will be suspended?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And it will be restored to you
immediately upon your release, understood?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right.

Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how you might
defend against the charges in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And both sides agree that Mr. McEnaney

is not a predicate felon?

MR. SAVINO: Correct.

months jail concurrent with five years probation subject to

the Waiver of Appeal and specific allocution. Have any

other promises been made to you?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

THE COURT: Do the People have any objection to an
adjournment for after the holidays?

MR. SAVINO: No, Judge.
THE COURT: All right. Then let's figure out a

date. How is January 11?

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

Proceedings 12

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

Proceedings 13

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and
operated a prostitution business where women you recruited

MR. SAVINO: Is it true that you facilitated dates

en anne,

RICHARD C. SOUTHARD, an attorney duly licensed in the State of New York, affirms the

1. lrepresent the defendant in the above-captioned matter.

2. I make this affirmation in support of the relief sought in the annexed Notice of Motion.
Annexed hereto are defendant’s demand for discovery and a bill of particulars.

3. The sources of the information and grounds for my belief reflected in this affirmation are
conversations with defendant, the assigned Assistant District Attorney, available court
records, and the voluntary disclosure form provided by the District Attorney.

4. Upon information and belief, the defendant Steven Mcenaney, was arrested on March 9,
2022 and charged with one count of Penal Law §230.25 (1), Promoting Prostitution in the
Third Degree.

5. The defendant was arraigned on a silent indictment charging him with one count of Penal
Law §230.25 (1), Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree on March 9, 2022 and

entered a plea of “not guilty” to said charge.


## Page 4

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of

the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

lil, BRADY

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

d. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witnesses have given statements that are or may be contradictory to each other;

e. Any information recounting a misidentification of the defendant as a perpetrator of the crime(s)
charged or indicating a failure on the part of any potential witness to identify the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime(s) charged;

f. Any information indicating that any prospective prosecution witness, has or had a history of
mental or emotional disturbance;

g. Full disclosure of any consideration, promise of consideration, or expectation of consideration
offered to any prospective prosecution witness, including any unindicted co-conspirators, but not
limited to, leniency, favorable treatment, assistance with respect to any pending legal proceeding, or
any reward or other benefit whatsoever that will or could be realized by the witness as a result of the
witness's testimony;

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and
unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the
probationary, parole, or custodial status of the witness, or any other pending or potential legal disputes
between the witness and the prosecution or over which the prosecution has a real, apparent, or
perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,
accomplice, or co-conspirator has testified before any court or grand jury, including date, caption, and
indictment number of the case;

j. Any malfunction of any instrumentality used for any scientific test for a period of 24 hours
immediately prior to the test or analysis involving the defendant until 24 hours thereafter;

k. Any repetition of any scientific test and any differing results obtained;


## Page 11

1. Any lack of qualification by any person performing any scientific test in connection with this
matter;

m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

approximately 2012 to 2017.

ii) Google records for the account ashleighscottt@gmail.com indicate that the account
belongs to Ashleigh Scott, Complainant-1. I am additionally informed by Complainant-1
that ashleighscottt@gmail.com was the email account she used to communicate with
McEnaney during the time period 2012 to 2017.

iii) In the email exchanges, McEnaney routinely corresponded with Complainant-1 about
times and locations where Complainant-1 was required to meet McEnaney’s clients, how
much money clients provided to Complainant-1, and other matters related to McEnaney’s
prostitution organization. See EXHIBITS 1A through 1D.

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted
physicalisurveillanceiof the TARGET PREMISES. At approximately 1035 hours, I observed
a 2013 White Ford C-Max with New York license plate KPR5958, The car was operated by a

white male wearing glasses, who turned onto Molly’s Way in the direction of the gated
driveway entrance to 22 Mollys Way.

i. The White Ford C-Max with license plate KPR5958 is registered
to Steven McEnaney, and the New York State DMVehasva

In addition to the physical surveillance I have conducted at the TARGET PREMISES, I have
reviewed various documentation where Steven McEnaney provided the TARGET PREMISES
as his home address:

1. Google records for the account Stevemac1676@gmail.com indicate that
the account belongs to Steven McEnaney.

the Subject Crimes that may be foun:
Paragraph 2 and 4.

Squad, the New York County District Attorney's Office High Technology and Analysis Unit
(HTAU”) ot other New York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training
and experience in computer forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant,
to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing
the computerized and electronic data described above from the electronic devices and any other
communications or electronic equipment recovered in connection with the execution of this search

warrant.

them into storage in another device.

## Page 13

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
NEW YORK COUNTY: CRIMINAL TERM PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”

Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

d. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witnesses have given statements that are or may be contradictory to each other;

charged or indicating a failure on the part of any potential witness to identify the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime(s) charged;

f. Any information indicating that any prospective prosecution witness, has or had a history of
mental or emotional disturbance;

g. Full disclosure of any consideration, promise of consideration, or expectation of consideration

witness's testimony;

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and
unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the

perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,

matter;
m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

People v, O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

at this time.

- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot

Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

Indictment No. 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant
I, Lawrence P. LaBrew, an attorney admitted to practice in all New York State Courts, do
hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2106, that the following
facts are true:
L. I am not a party to the action, and I am over 18 years of age. My office is located at 30
Wall Street 8" Floor, New York, New York 10005.
2s I am the attorney for Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. On2 February 2024, at 7:45 p.m., I served the Defendant's Motion to Withdraw his Plea
of Guilty, with the attached Exhibits, on the New York County District Attorney’s Office.

indictment Number 70297-2022 AL TERM (EDDS 01/08/2024 03:14 PI

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in
criminal cases’” ( People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, Iv denied 82 NY2d 717, quoting

-against- DECISION AND ORDER
Ind. No. 70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,
Defendant
nnn te. .6.).t 2 Se X

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

## Page 4

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of

the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

but not limited to video pertaining to defendant’s arrest.

14. Copies of all documents, police reports, notes, or memoranda, prepared or maintained by police
officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

a. copies of all search and/or arrest warrants, together with all supporting affidavits and any other

not;

h. diagrams, charts or other intended to be used at trial by prosecution witnesses or by the

i. any signatures or writing samples taken of defendant during the booking process;

j. any written waiver or any evidence of any evidence of waiver alleged by the People to have been

testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

NOTICE OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES! 62 MAR 0.9 2929

If you are not a United States citizen, a plea of guilty to any offense, a conviction by trial verdict, or a youthful
offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the
defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE
8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who
previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE


## Page 5

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

Complai babl istedmtombeli heedefendant’s»pri
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012

While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant

to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient

residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.



## Page 6

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the

defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).
‘ PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
i DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

Lo



## Page 7

thereof of every alibi witness upon whom the defendant intends to rely to establish the

defendant’s presence elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.

Wherefore, it is respectfully requested that, except as consented to herein, the

defendant’s motion should be denied.

REME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

AFFIRMATION &
MEMORANDUM OF
LAW IN RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT'S
MOTION TO
WITHDRAW GUILTY
PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

appellate rights. So, for example, if any sentence I

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

to execute the Waiver of Appeal or the plea agreement, you

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

understand?

Yes.

THE DEFENDANT:

THE COURT: All right.

Do you also understand that while you are

incarcerated, your right to vote in any city, state or

federal election will be suspended?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And it will be restored to you
immediately upon your release, understood?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right.

Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how you might
defend against the charges in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And both sides agree that Mr. McEnaney

is not a predicate felon?

MR. SAVINO: Correct.

THE COURT: All right.

So the promised sentence in this case is four

months jail concurrent with five years probation subject to

the Waiver of Appeal and specific allocution. Have any

other promises been made to you?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

THE COURT: Do the People have any objection to an
adjournment for after the holidays?

MR. SAVINO: No, Judge.
THE COURT: All right. Then let's figure out a

date. How is January 11?

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and
operated a prostitution business where women you recruited

entered a plea of “not guilty” to said charge.


## Page 4

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

any stage of the proceedings, the name and address of the witness and the circumstances under which

the observations took place;

6. Names and addresses of all witnesses (including government employees, agents, or informants) to

any events which form the basis for these charges;

engaged in law enforcement activity or by a person whom the prosecutor intends to call as a witness at

trial, or which the People intend to introduce at trial;

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of
all persons to whom the photographs or drawings were exhibited, as well as any documents that reflect
the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

13. Any tapes or other electronic recordings that the prosecutor intends to introduce at trial

regardless of whether such recording was made during the course of the criminal transaction; including

but not limited to video pertaining to defendant’s arrest.

14. Copies of all documents, police reports, notes, or memoranda, prepared or maintained by police
officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

a. copies of all search and/or arrest warrants, together with all supporting affidavits and any other
documents in support of any warrant that resulted in the arrest of the defendant or the seizure of any
property in this case;

b. any documents reflecting by whom, the exact date, time, location and manner in which the events
underlying the charged offense were reported to the police, including handwritten and typed arrest
reports, UF61 or other complaint reports, pre-arraignment forms, aided reports, supervisor’s reports,
Unusual Occurrence Reports, Evidence Collection Unit Reports, Stop and Frisk Reports, OLBS
Worksheets, Police Service Request cards, complaint follow-ups, Stop and Frisk Reports, on-line

not;

f. any grand jury referral forms;

conduct of this investigation in any respect;

h. diagrams, charts or other intended to be used at trial by prosecution witnesses or by the
prosecutor

i. any signatures or writing samples taken of defendant during the booking process;

j. any written waiver or any evidence of any evidence of waiver alleged by the People to have been
made by defendant concerning any statutory or Constitutional rights.

k. any radio communications relating to the observation of defendant, his conduct, or relating to
defendant's arrest in general.

15. An itemized description of any property recovered or seized during the investigation of the

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and

perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,
accomplice, or co-conspirator has testified before any court or grand jury, including date, caption, and
indictment number of the case;

j. Any malfunction of any instrumentality used for any scientific test for a period of 24 hours

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the


## Page 17

defendant re
quests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest Tec ict i0T 1
ord, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of

such | . oe ge
ch information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence

deo . . .

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

disagreements they might have with his prostitution organization.
13. By reportedly placing hidden cameras in the work apartment, McEnaney maintained the ultimate
leverage over both the clients and women. Any risk or threat of exposing McEnaney, non-payment

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People

argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was

counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth

‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Page 15 of 16

## Page 16

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

performed on any physical evidence or sample seized.

17. The name and field of expertise of each person that the People intend to call at trial as an expert
witness, as well as:

a. the field and subject matter of the expert's expected testimony;

testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

## Page 34

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

»Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

Dated: New York, New York a

14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

2 information and materials be kept in defense counsel's sole

3 possession and not copied, disclosed or disseminated. We are

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

i) in the presence of defense counsel and not copy, photograph

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

10 We have already provided defense counsel with all
11 the discovery in the case that is not included within the

14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.

19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail

25 included in those accounts.

9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should

4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the

7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.

17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

THE COURT: That's my calendar day. Apparently
the Brady orders were not signed when this case was
arraigned, so I'm signing them now.

MR. SOUTHARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: So, May 4th to review discovery
compliance. Be here at 9:30 and I will have you out by 9:40.

MR. SOUTHARD: One more matter.

When I had first taken over the case, since the
People have not made any offer in the case whatsoever, I
asked if Your Honor would consider probation. You said you
hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

THE COURT: So, this appears to be an E Felony.

MR. SAVINO: D Felony.

THE COURT: All right.

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to

To: Richard Southard <southardlaw@gmail.com>

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in

HE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against- DECISION AND ORDER
Ind. No. 70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,
Defendant
nnn te. .6.).t 2 Se X

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the
defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE
8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who
previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE


## Page 5

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

Complai babl istedmtombeli heedefendant’s»pri
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012

While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant

to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient

residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.



## Page 6

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the

defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).
‘ PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
i DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

Lo

thereof of every alibi witness upon whom the defendant intends to rely to establish the

defendant’s presence elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.

Wherefore, it is respectfully requested that, except as consented to herein, the

defendant’s motion should be denied.

PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Z


## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

Thank you.

comfortable with three months, but would do four months,

five years probation split with a Waiver of Appeal and

specific allocution if he is interested in disposing of the

case today.

MR. SOUTHARD: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: He is. All right.

So, please give me a COpy of the indictment, Mr.

Savino.

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

the signed Waiver of Appeal .

THE COURT: All right.

MR. SAVINO: And I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Then at this time, counsel, does your

client wish to withdraw his previously entered plea of not

guilty, and enter a plea of guilty to the sole count in the

indictment of promoting prostitution in the third degree in

exchange for a promised sentence of four months jail

concurrent with five years probation split, subject to a

Waiver of Appeal and the specific allocution proposed by

the People?

MR. SOUTHARD: He does, your Honor.

you affirm?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: State your full name for the record,

THE DEFENDANT: Stephen E. McEnaney.

THE COURT: Mr. McEnaney, listen to me carefully.

I will be asking you a series of questions. If at any time

you don't understand me, let me know, and if you need to
have time to speak to your attorney, I'm happy to let you
do that, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, for the record, is Mr. Richard
Southard who is seated next to you your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have you had enough time to fully
discuss your plea and sentence with your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the
representation you have received from him?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And are you pleading guilty to this
charge because you are in fact guilty?

THE COURT: Has anyone forced or threatened you to
plead guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: Are you on any drugs, medication or
alcohol today?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: So you fully understand what is
happening here, correct?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: When you plead guilty, you give up
certain valuable constitutional rights including but not

limited to the right to remain silent, the right toa

trial, the right to confront the witnesses who testify

against you at trial, to require the People to prove your
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to testify on your own
behalf and call witnesses on your own behalf, if that's
what you choose to do, as well as the right to contest any
search or seizure which may have occurred in this case. Do
you willingly and voluntarily give up each of those
valuable rights?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, People, is there a Certificate of
Compliance in the case?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

Proceedings 12

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and

photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

13. Any tapes or other electronic recordings that the prosecutor intends to introduce at trial

regardless of whether such recording was made during the course of the criminal transaction; including

but not limited to video pertaining to defendant’s arrest.

14. Copies of all documents, police reports, notes, or memoranda, prepared or maintained by police
officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

a. copies of all search and/or arrest warrants, together with all supporting affidavits and any other
documents in support of any warrant that resulted in the arrest of the defendant or the seizure of any
property in this case;

b. any documents reflecting by whom, the exact date, time, location and manner in which the events
underlying the charged offense were reported to the police, including handwritten and typed arrest
reports, UF61 or other complaint reports, pre-arraignment forms, aided reports, supervisor’s reports,
Unusual Occurrence Reports, Evidence Collection Unit Reports, Stop and Frisk Reports, OLBS
Worksheets, Police Service Request cards, complaint follow-ups, Stop and Frisk Reports, on-line
booking sheets, precinct log book entries and handwritten and typed notes of any officer participating
in the investigation leading to defendant’s indictment;

c. the exact time and manner by which a law enforcement official was first alerted to the incident
which resulted in the defendant’s arrest;

d. tape recordings, complaint logs, and transcripts relating to any "911" call or call to the police

i. any signatures or writing samples taken of defendant during the booking process;

j. any written waiver or any evidence of any evidence of waiver alleged by the People to have been

## Page 8

was pursuant to a warrant;

16. Any records or documents, including handwritten notes, relating to any test or analysis

performed on any physical evidence or sample seized.

17. The name and field of expertise of each person that the People intend to call at trial as an expert

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

site seatching.»Based upon my training and experience, the examination of such devices can be a
time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical
requirements of forensic examination, I am aware that searching and seizing information from
such devices often requires police officers to seize most or all such devices along with related
peripherals and software to be seatched later by a qualified person in a laboratory or other

controlled environment.

6. Itis also requested that the warrant be deemed executed once any computers, computer storage
media, electronic communication equipment, and other data storage devices and media have been

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted
physicalisurveillanceiof the TARGET PREMISES. At approximately 1035 hours, I observed
a 2013 White Ford C-Max with New York license plate KPR5958, The car was operated by a

white male wearing glasses, who turned onto Molly’s Way in the direction of the gated
driveway entrance to 22 Mollys Way.

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

NEW YORK COUNTY: CRIMINAL TERM PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

2639 (1986), citing United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 657 n.20, 104 S. Ct. 20397
(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”
People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005).

Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632 N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995) (“The People's
argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

People v, O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

Dated: New York, New York a

6 New York, New York. Good morning.
7 THE COURT: Good morning.
8 MR. SAVINO: For the People Keith Savino,
2) SAVINO. Good morning.
10 THE COURT: So, we have before the Court People's
11 Motion for Protective Order.
12 Without getting into the factual assertions you
L3 are seeking to protect, why don't you make a record of the
14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las
15 order.
16 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Your Honor. I will go through a
17 short but detailed account here.
18 So, the People will primarily rely on the motion
Lo papers setting forth fact as arguments under CPL 245.70 sub
20 Ls
21 We are seeking the delay, until commencement of
Ze jury selection, disclosure of the names and contact
29 information and other identifying information of 11 witnesses
24 that will either be called to testify or whose names will
25 appear throughout the trial, in various forms of evidence.

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

2 information and materials be kept in defense counsel's sole

3 possession and not copied, disclosed or disseminated. We are

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

i) in the presence of defense counsel and not copy, photograph

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

2 sites.
10 We have already provided defense counsel with all
11 the discovery in the case that is not included within the
12 Protective Order. I would like to file and serve a copy.
13 THE COURT: With»xespectitojstatements'made"by the
14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.
18 MR. SAVINO: We have not, Judge.
19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail
24 returns by each person. It would just be all the e-mails
25 included in those accounts.

1 THE COURT: Have any of those witnesses whose
2 identities you are seeking to protect until jury selection,
S made statements that would be discoverable?
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes.
5 THE COURT: And have you provided those statements
6 to defense counsel yet?
7 MR. SAVINO: Not yet.
8 THE COURT: And those are part of the materials
, that you are seeking to withhold at this time?
10 MR. SAVINO: Correct.
11 THE COURT: And why could the substance of those
12 statements or testimony not be revealed now, at least to
fs: defense counsel, for his eyes only?
i MR. SAVINO: A limited summary of that could be
15 turned over. I did not want to do that until we actually had
16 this hearing. I submitted this Protective Order almost a
17 year ago. So, it's just been between the different Judges.
18 THE COURT: I just received it.
19 MR. SAVINO: I understand.
20 THE COURT: I want the record to be clear that I
21 was not the first Judge on this case, and there had been
ae several changes in defense counsels, then a change in Judges.
23 So, this is the first opportunity I have had to review the
24 materials.

1 provide summaries once we figure out what can be disclosed.
2 THE COURT: That should be done as expeditiously as
8 possible.
4 MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.
5 THE COURT: And briefly, for the record, state the
6 basis for your belief that you have established the necessary
7 standard for withholding the other information until the
8 start of jury selection.
9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received
2 from this prostitution organization; voluminous phone

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

When I had first taken over the case, since the

asked if Your Honor would consider probation. You said you
hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

3. 1 originally retained a civil attorney, who had done business with my family in the past, to
represent me in this casc. His name is Mr. James Nemia.

statute of limitations issue related to the charges, and that the statute of limitations issue
could be addressed in a motion. .
5. T eventually retained Mr. Richard Southard to represent me because I wanted an
experienced criminal attomey, and he stated that he had an extensive background

about the statute of limitations. I informed Mr. Southard that my prior attorney said that
there might be a statute of limitations issue related to the case. I asked Mr. Southard
several times, on numerous occasions, how could I be accused of something that

happened ycars ago, and could he make a motion to dismiss the casc because the

regard to Mr. DiMenna. I was not present when my attorncy met with the Assistant
District Attorney, and the Judge. I had previously told Mr. Southard that I wanted to be
present at all proceedings regarding my case, Mr. Southard did not have my permission to

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

8. l asked Mr. Southard why the statute of limitations had not expired for me, since he said

that the statute of limitations had expired for Mr. DiMenna, and he repeated that the
District Attorney told him that the statue of limitations had expired for Mr. DiMenna and
not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to
contact, and the few times that we did speak about the case, the conversations were not
productive. I never fully understood what was happening in my casc. He just kept telling
me that the Judge hates me and wants to put me in jail. ] have attached a couple of e-

mails that I sent Mr. Southard expressing my concems about my case.

10. Mr. Southard told me that my best bet was to take a plea, because the Assistant District

To: Richard Southard <southardlaw@gmail.com>

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the

memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the
probationary, parole, or custodial status of the witness, or any other pending or potential legal disputes
between the witness and the prosecution or over which the prosecution has a real, apparent, or

matter;

m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

NOTICE OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES! 62 MAR 0.9 2929

If you are not a United States citizen, a plea of guilty to any offense, a conviction by trial verdict, or a youthful
offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S

MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.

MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).

AFFIRMATION &
MEMORANDUM OF
LAW IN RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT'S
MOTION TO
WITHDRAW GUILTY
PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Z


## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

Proceedings 2

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

Sati Singh, RPR

## Page 19

Proceedings 3

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

MR. SOUTHARD: Not today, your Honor. He is

interested in the 90-days split and would be prepared to

move forward today on that if your Honor would grant Bo

THE COURT: I'm not going to give the three-month

split. I will agree to impose four months concurrent with

five years probation split then if he takes it today.

Can we have a second call so I may

speak to him on that, Judge?

THE COURT: Yes.

Thank you.

MR. SOUTHARD:

THE CLERK: Recalling number 21 on the calendar in

comfortable with three months, but would do four months,

five years probation split with a Waiver of Appeal and

specific allocution if he is interested in disposing of the

case today.

MR. SOUTHARD: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: He is. All right.

So, please give me a COpy of the indictment, Mr.

Savino.

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

the signed Waiver of Appeal .

THE COURT: All right.

MR. SAVINO: And I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Then at this time, counsel, does your

client wish to withdraw his previously entered plea of not

guilty, and enter a plea of guilty to the sole count in the

indictment of promoting prostitution in the third degree in

exchange for a promised sentence of four months jail

concurrent with five years probation split, subject to a

Waiver of Appeal and the specific allocution proposed by

the People?

MR. SOUTHARD: He does, your Honor.

THE COURT:

All right.

Please swear Mr. Mcknaney.

Steven McEnaney, do you swear Or affirm that the

evidence you shall give this Court will be the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God or so
you affirm?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: State your full name for the record,
please.

THE DEFENDANT: Stephen E. McEnaney.

THE COURT: Mr. McEnaney, listen to me carefully.

I will be asking you a series of questions. If at any time

you don't understand me, let me know, and if you need to
have time to speak to your attorney, I'm happy to let you
do that, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, for the record, is Mr. Richard
Southard who is seated next to you your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have you had enough time to fully
discuss your plea and sentence with your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the
representation you have received from him?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And are you pleading guilty to this
charge because you are in fact guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Has anyone forced or threatened you to
plead guilty?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: Are you on any drugs, medication or
alcohol today?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: So you fully understand what is
happening here, correct?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: When you plead guilty, you give up
certain valuable constitutional rights including but not

limited to the right to remain silent, the right toa

trial, the right to confront the witnesses who testify

against you at trial, to require the People to prove your
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to testify on your own
behalf and call witnesses on your own behalf, if that's
what you choose to do, as well as the right to contest any
search or seizure which may have occurred in this case. Do
you willingly and voluntarily give up each of those
valuable rights?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, People, is there a Certificate of
Compliance in the case?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

discovery?

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You do however retain certain

appellate rights. So, for example, if any sentence I

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

to execute the Waiver of Appeal or the plea agreement, you

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

understand?

Yes.

THE DEFENDANT:

THE COURT: All right.

Do you also understand that while you are

incarcerated, your right to vote in any city, state or

federal election will be suspended?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And it will be restored to you
immediately upon your release, understood?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right.

Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how you might
defend against the charges in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And both sides agree that Mr. McEnaney

is not a predicate felon?

months jail concurrent with five years probation subject to

the Waiver of Appeal and specific allocution. Have any

other promises been made to you?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

THE COURT: Do the People have any objection to an
adjournment for after the holidays?

MR. SAVINO: No, Judge.
THE COURT: All right. Then let's figure out a

date. How is January 11?

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

Proceedings 12

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

Proceedings 13

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and
operated a prostitution business where women you recruited

MR. SAVINO: Is it true that you facilitated dates

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

MR. SAVINO: I'm withdrawing that one, Judge.

Cefendant Steven McEnaney reported that he was born on 12/16/1976 in Mineola, New York from the union of Alice
fyicEnaney, age 72, and Edward McEnaney, age 73. He explained that he raised in Hicksville, Long Island. His parents
were childhood sweethearts and have been married for over 50 years. They remain in Hicksville, Long Island.

The defendant informed that he was raised alongside his sister, Kristen McEnaney, age 40, residing in Mineola, NY and
his brother, Jason McEnaney, age 48, residing in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. His sister is reportedly employed as a
CFO of a mortgage company and his brother is reportedly employed as a schoolteacher.

The defendant mentioned that his family is not aware of his current legal circumstances. However, he insisted that he
has a good relationship with his family. The defendant described his childhood as fine until the age of 8 or 9. However,
he disclosed that he was sexually molested by his maternal grandfather “for several years" until the age of 11.

The defendant stated that he has never participated in any therapy for the childhood ordeal. He claimed that he later
found out that the person he and his mother thought was his grandfather was actually not related to him. He feels that
there was a connection for him being targeted for sexual molestation by the grandfather based on his unrelated ties. The
defendant stated that he actually did not recall anything about his childhood trauma until he was about 30 years old. His
mother was informed at that time and the defendant stated that she was devastated and that she actually participated in
therapy once she learned about what transpired. The defendant informed that he immersed himself in music. He
mentioned that he played the drums, guitar and the piano. He added that this helped him to cope with the molestation

ordeal.
The defendant denied that he was ever in a gang. He is single and he indicated that he resides at 22 Mollys Way, Salt

Point, NY 12578 located in Dutchess County, NY. The defendant explained that he purchased the home in 2016 and that
he currently resides at the aforementioned location with his friend, Ksenia Dickson, age 40, and her three months old

son, Leo Cooperman.
The defendant reported that there are 2 dogs ("mutts"); 10 cats; and 146 other animals (including horses, cows, pigs,

birds and alpacas). The defendant further reported that he has a not for profit animal sanctuary, Hunks and Hunnies
Animal Sanctuary, located at 83 Wood Street, Mahopac, NY. He stated that his animal sanctuary was incorporated in

2019.

The defendant explained that he has a son, Reed Corazzini, age 10, from a prior relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Kim
Corazzini, age 40. His son was residing with him until Sept. 2023. His son, Reed, now resides temporarily with his
mother in Wappingers Falls, NY. The defendant reported that he and Ms. Corazzini are in the middle of a custody battle.
The next hearing is scheduled for 11/14/23. The defendant provided his friend, Alex Sibersky, age 80, as his emergency
contact at tel. # (917)710-5448. Mr. Sibersky reportedly resides at 185 Lenox Avenue, New York, NY 10027. Defendant
McEnaney stated that he and Mr. Sibersky have been friends since 2008. He further stated that Mr. Sibersky suffers from

Parkinson's Disease.
*A check of the Worker Connect database did not result in any verification documentation found pertaining to the
defendant.

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Any lack of qualification by any person performing any scientific test in connection with this
matter;

m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted
physicalisurveillanceiof the TARGET PREMISES. At approximately 1035 hours, I observed
a 2013 White Ford C-Max with New York license plate KPR5958, The car was operated by a

white male wearing glasses, who turned onto Molly’s Way in the direction of the gated
driveway entrance to 22 Mollys Way.

i. The White Ford C-Max with license plate KPR5958 is registered
to Steven McEnaney, and the New York State DMVehasva

the Subject Crimes that may be foun:
Paragraph 2 and 4.

Squad, the New York County District Attorney's Office High Technology and Analysis Unit
(HTAU”) ot other New York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training
and experience in computer forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant,
to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing

communications or electronic equipment recovered in connection with the execution of this search

warrant.

them into storage in another device.

## Page 13

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

NEW YORK COUNTY: CRIMINAL TERM PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

(1984), People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188-189, 615 N.Y.S.2d 662 (1994). Therefore,
“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People
v. Hobot, 84 N.Y.2d 1021, 1022 [1995]); People v. Flores, 84 N.Y.2d 184, 188 [1994]).”

argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was
not a waiver of his right to claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “the
voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel's advice” was within the range of
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases”’), and Hill v. Lockhart, 474 US.
52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 370 (1985) (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v.
Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of
counsel. In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test is
nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth
in Tollett v. Henderson, supra, and McMann v. Richardson, supra. The second, or
‘prejudice,’ requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel's constitutionally
ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d
436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

b. Any statements known to be false or erroneous made to a public servant engaged in law
enforcement activity or a grand jury or a court by persons intended to be called as witnesses;

c. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witness on any occasion gave false, misleading or contradictory information regarding the
charge at bar or any related matters, to persons involved in law enforcement or to their agents or
informers;

d. Any evidence, testimony, transcript, statement or information indicating that any prospective
prosecution witnesses have given statements that are or may be contradictory to each other;

charged or indicating a failure on the part of any potential witness to identify the defendant as the
perpetrator of the crime(s) charged;

f. Any information indicating that any prospective prosecution witness, has or had a history of
mental or emotional disturbance;

g. Full disclosure of any consideration, promise of consideration, or expectation of consideration

witness's testimony;

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and
unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the
probationary, parole, or custodial status of the witness, or any other pending or potential legal disputes
between the witness and the prosecution or over which the prosecution has a real, apparent, or
perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,
accomplice, or co-conspirator has testified before any court or grand jury, including date, caption, and

1. Any lack of qualification by any person performing any scientific test in connection with this

matter;
m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper
acquisition of some other evidence or information;

n. All evidence in the possession, custody or control of the District Attorney or any police agency,
the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

People v, O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed
identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received
2 from this prostitution organization; voluminous phone

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.
24 Even, by way of example, the application to Your
25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week

indictment Number 70297-2022 AL TERM (EDDS 01/08/2024 03:14 PI

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in
criminal cases’” ( People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, Iv denied 82 NY2d 717, quoting

-against- DECISION AND ORDER
Ind. No. 70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,
Defendant
nnn te. .6.).t 2 Se X

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of
all persons to whom the photographs or drawings were exhibited, as well as any documents that reflect
the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

but not limited to video pertaining to defendant’s arrest.

14. Copies of all documents, police reports, notes, or memoranda, prepared or maintained by police
officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

not;

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

NOTICE OF IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES! 62 MAR 0.9 2929

If you are not a United States citizen, a plea of guilty to any offense, a conviction by trial verdict, or a youthful
offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the
defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE
8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who
previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE


## Page 5

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant

to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient

residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.



## Page 6

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the

defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).
‘ PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
i DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

Lo

thereof of every alibi witness upon whom the defendant intends to rely to establish the

defendant’s presence elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.

defendant’s motion should be denied.

COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

AFFIRMATION &
MEMORANDUM OF
LAW IN RESPONSE TO
DEFENDANT'S
MOTION TO
WITHDRAW GUILTY
PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.


## Page 6

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

6


## Page 7

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

7


## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

discovery?

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You do however retain certain

appellate rights. So, for example, if any sentence I

impose upon you would be an illegal sentence, or you would

be denied your constitutional speedy trial rights in this

case or you did not have the legal ability to stand trial,

to execute the Waiver of Appeal or the plea agreement, you

may still challenge those matters on appeal, do you

understand?

Yes.

THE DEFENDANT:

THE COURT: All right.

Do you also understand that while you are

incarcerated, your right to vote in any city, state or

federal election will be suspended?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And it will be restored to you
immediately upon your release, understood?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right.

Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how you might
defend against the charges in this case?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And both sides agree that Mr. McEnaney

is not a predicate felon?

MR. SAVINO: Correct.

THE COURT: All right.

months jail concurrent with five years probation subject to

the Waiver of Appeal and specific allocution. Have any

other promises been made to you?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

THE COURT: Do the People have any objection to an
adjournment for after the holidays?

MR. SAVINO: No, Judge.
THE COURT: All right. Then let's figure out a

date. How is January 11?

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by
managing, supervising, controlling and owning alone, and in
association with others, a house of prostitution, and a
prostitution business and enterprise involving prostitution
activity by two or more persons for prostitution; is that
true, sir?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. People, why don't you take
him through your specific plea allocution.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

Steven McEnaney, is it true that from on or about
May 12 -- May 2012 to January 2018, you managed and

## Page 4

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

enforcement officer, including but not limited to, any physical description of the alleged perpetrator,
the names of the witnesses providing descriptions, the names of law enforcement officers to whom
they were provided, and the date, time and location where such description was given and any reports

or documents relating to such description;

5. If the defendant was viewed or observed by any witness other than a law enforcement officer at
any stage of the proceedings, the name and address of the witness and the circumstances under which

the observations took place;

6. Names and addresses of all witnesses (including government employees, agents, or informants) to

any events which form the basis for these charges;

7. Names of all law enforcement personnel present when the accused was taken into custody.

case; and whether any search warrants were applied for, granted or denied and any inventory of said

warrants.

9. Any photograph or drawing relating to the criminal proceeding taken or made by a public servant
engaged in law enforcement activity or by a person whom the prosecutor intends to call as a witness at

trial, or which the People intend to introduce at trial;

10. Any photograph or drawing purporting to contain the likeness of a human being that was shown
to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of
all persons to whom the photographs or drawings were exhibited, as well as any documents that reflect
the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

13. Any tapes or other electronic recordings that the prosecutor intends to introduce at trial


## Page 7

regardless of whether such recording was made during the course of the criminal transaction; including

but not limited to video pertaining to defendant’s arrest.

14. Copies of all documents, police reports, notes, or memoranda, prepared or maintained by police
officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

a. copies of all search and/or arrest warrants, together with all supporting affidavits and any other
documents in support of any warrant that resulted in the arrest of the defendant or the seizure of any
property in this case;

b. any documents reflecting by whom, the exact date, time, location and manner in which the events
underlying the charged offense were reported to the police, including handwritten and typed arrest
reports, UF61 or other complaint reports, pre-arraignment forms, aided reports, supervisor’s reports,
Unusual Occurrence Reports, Evidence Collection Unit Reports, Stop and Frisk Reports, OLBS
Worksheets, Police Service Request cards, complaint follow-ups, Stop and Frisk Reports, on-line

in the investigation leading to defendant’s indictment;

c. the exact time and manner by which a law enforcement official was first alerted to the incident
which resulted in the defendant’s arrest;

d. tape recordings, complaint logs, and transcripts relating to any "911" call or call to the police
relating to the crime charged;

d. tape recordings, dispatcher logs, transcripts or memoranda recording any police

defendant’s drivers license, license plates, vehicle and of the seized weapon;

e. any notes made by police officials concerning their investigation, whether to be used at trial or
not;

f. any grand jury referral forms;

g. any portion of any police department manual, directive, or policy statement governing the police
conduct of this investigation in any respect;

h. diagrams, charts or other intended to be used at trial by prosecution witnesses or by the
prosecutor

i. any signatures or writing samples taken of defendant during the booking process;

j. any written waiver or any evidence of any evidence of waiver alleged by the People to have been
made by defendant concerning any statutory or Constitutional rights.

k. any radio communications relating to the observation of defendant, his conduct, or relating to
defendant's arrest in general.

15. An itemized description of any property recovered or seized during the investigation of the
charges, the person or place from which the property was taken, the person effecting such seizure or

16. Any records or documents, including handwritten notes, relating to any test or analysis

performed on any physical evidence or sample seized.

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted

to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving, printing, copying, or otherwise seizing

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

Case No.

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

## Page 16

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19, CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific

defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v, Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

## Page 34

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

»Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

4. 1 have endeavored to encompass within this Omnibus Motion all possible pretrial requests

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

upon defense counsel and filed with the court within fifteen (15) days of the service of this demand,

must be in writing, and must set forth the grounds of such belief as fully as possible.

VIL. PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that, pursuant to CPL 240.80(3), absent a refusal by the

fifteen (15) days of the service of this demand.

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

14 grounds that you believe establish your entitlement to Las

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

2 information and materials be kept in defense counsel's sole

3 possession and not copied, disclosed or disseminated. We are

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

i) in the presence of defense counsel and not copy, photograph

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

10 We have already provided defense counsel with all

14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.

19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received
oe through search warrants. So, there is really no way to kind
23 of label the different e-mail addresses or different e-mail

25 included in those accounts.

9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.

25 Honor, there are some upwards of 20 pages that were

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the

18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

THE COURT: That's my calendar day. Apparently
the Brady orders were not signed when this case was
arraigned, so I'm signing them now.

MR. SOUTHARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: So, May 4th to review discovery
compliance. Be here at 9:30 and I will have you out by 9:40.

MR. SOUTHARD: One more matter.

When I had first taken over the case, since the
People have not made any offer in the case whatsoever, I
asked if Your Honor would consider probation. You said you
hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

THE COURT: So, this appears to be an E Felony.

MR. SAVINO: D Felony.

THE COURT: All right.

present at all proceedings regarding my case, Mr. Southard did not have my permission to

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to

To: Richard Southard <southardlaw@gmail.com>

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

O-

Ct. 2557, 2561 (2006) (“The Sixth Amendment provides that ‘[iJn all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for
his defence.’ We have previously held that an element of this right is the right of a

defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him. See

Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S. Ct. 1692, 100 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1988).

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in
criminal cases’” ( People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, Iv denied 82 NY2d 717, quoting
Hill v Lockhart, 474 US 52, 56, quoting McMann y Richardson, 397 US 759, 771).”).

-against- DECISION AND ORDER
Ind. No. 70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,
Defendant
nnn te. .6.).t 2 Se X

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

site seatching.»Based upon my training and experience, the examination of such devices can be a
time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

HE TARGET PREMISES
22 MOLLYS WAY, SALT POINT, NY 12578

I reviewed New York State DMV records which indicate that Steven McEnaney provided the
TARGET PREMISES as his petmanent address to the state DMV. I am informed by
Investigative Analyst Janine Nassar of DANY HTRU that she reviewed records provided by

Flagstar Bank; these records indicated that Steven McEnaney took out a mortgage from
GuardHill Financial Corporation for the TARGET PREMISES on August 15, 2016.

On February 22, 2022 I, along with DANY Senior Investigator Steven Lane, conducted
physicalisurveillanceiof the TARGET PREMISES. At approximately 1035 hours, I observed
a 2013 White Ford C-Max with New York license plate KPR5958, The car was operated by a

white male wearing glasses, who turned onto Molly’s Way in the direction of the gated
driveway entrance to 22 Mollys Way.

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,
operation systems, and types of content stored. Because of the volume of evidence and technical

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

iii) In the email exchanges, McEnaney routinely corresponded with Complainant-1 about
times and locations where Complainant-1 was required to meet McEnaney’s clients, how
much money clients provided to Complainant-1, and other matters related to McEnaney’s
prostitution organization. See EXHIBITS 1A through 1D.

time-consuming process due to the constantly changing universe of technologies, models,

IN AFF. A

ON mn cee eae te te

During my career as a Senior Investigator for the New York County District Attorney’s Office and

my time as a Detective in the NYPD, I have been involved in the investigation of prostitution and
sex trafficking enterprises for approximately 21 years. During my time with the NYPD, I participated
in sex crimes training, criminal investigations courses, seminars and training on human trafficking and
prostitution, and extensive on the job training. As a Senior Investigator, I have conducted physical
surveillance, executed court-authorized search warrants, and used other investigative techniques to
secure relevant information. As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the methods
and techniques of human trafficking and promoting prostitution, including the use of computers,
cellular telephones, social media, email, and the internet in connection with this kind of criminal
activity.

As a result of my training and experience, I am familiar with the various methods employed by
prostitution rings and sex traffickers, including but not limited to: (i) soliciting prostitution clients, (ii)

gaining and maintaining control over trafficking victims, (iii) use of code words, (iv) laundering
proceeds of prostitution activities, (v) use of computers and cellular telephones, and (vi) use of e-mail.

Further, I am familiar with many of the methods utilized by persons engaged in sex trafficking and
prostitution. I am familiar with how they use the internet, text messaging, email, social media
including Instagram and Facebook, and other means of electronic communication to facilitate their
crimes. For example, I have participated in several Sex Trafficking and Promoting Prostitution
investigations which have revealed that there are numerous communications daily between
individuals involved in prostitution and their “pimps” through the use of cellular telephones and
email accounts. In addition, from my training and experience, I am aware that individuals who are
involved in promoting prostitution often use websites to advertise the services of prostituted
individuals. These advertisements often contain pictures of the prostituted individual and/or the
prostituted individual’s body parts in a sexually explicit fashion. These advertisements also often
contain sexually explicit descriptions of the prostituted individual’s body and/or body part and
describe the sexual services offered.

I have personally participated in the investigation of the crimes discussed below, and I am familiar
with the facts and circumstances of this investigation. Unless otherwise noted, wherever in this
affidavit I assert that a statement was made or that an event occurred, that assertion is made on
information and belief, the source of that information being my own personal observations and
participation in this investigation, my own review of documents relating to this investigation, my own
interviews of witnesses, and information from other law enforcement officers or agents with whom
T have spoken or whose reports ] have reviewed.

The facts and circumstances of this investigation have been summarized for the specific purpose of
this application. Since this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing
probable cause for this search warrant, I have not set forth each and every fact learned during this
investigation.


## Page 6

14. Asset forth below, there is probable cause to believe the TARGET PREMISES has been
used, or was possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of the
Subject Crime, of that contents of the TARGET PREMISES constitute evidence or tend to demonstrate
that a crime was committed or that a particular person participated in the commission of a crime. My
basis for believing that the ctime was committed and that the evidence sought is located within the
TARGET PREMISES is as follows:

Bac d on the Steve Enaney Investigation

a. [have spoken with an individual named Ashleigh Scott (Complainant-1), of an address known
to the District Attorney’s Office. In addition to interviews I conducted with Complainant-1,
Complainant-1 has also met with representatives from the DANY Human Trafficking
Response Unit on several occasions, I have also spoken with Janine Nassar, an Investigative
Analyst with the DANY Human Trafficking Response Unit, who was present fot interviews
with Complainant-1 in the fall and winter of 2021 and in February 2022. The following
information is based on interviews I personally conducted with Complainant-1 as well as my
conversations with Ms. Nassar about interviews she was present for with Complainant-1:

i. Complainant-1 currently lives in Florida but had previously lived
in New York between approximately 2012 and 2017. Complainant-
1 began looking for acting and escort jobs on Craigslist and
Backpage in the New York area. Eventually, Complainant-1
responded to an advertisement on Backpage, resulting in a meeting
withyanvindividualy named" Steven’ McEnaney at a location in
Manhattan.

ii. Beginning in laté 2012, McEnaney offered Complainant-1 a job
workingwformhismescortwagencyssAsmpartmof the position,
Complainant-1 had explicit photos taken of her at Governor’s
Island so that McEnaney could advertise her on the Internet.
McEnaney created a website for Complainant-1 and maintained
exclusive control over the content posted to the site. Furthermore,
McEnaney communicated with prospective clients online and
through emails and text messages, pretending to be Complainant-
16

iii, McEnaney began prostituting Complainant-1, requiring her to
have sex for money. McEnaney also provided Complainant-1 an
apartment to live in on 54” Street and 2" Avenue in Manhattan.

Initially, Complainant-1 collected ™atfeemof approximately

$1000/hour with clients, with Complainant-1 keeping 75% of the

money and McEnaney receiving the other 25%.

xiii. Eventually, McEnaney began reducing Complainant-1’s payments
for sex work, keeping a larger percentage of the payments from
clients for himself. Between about 2015 through 2017, McEnaney
would take approximately $30,000 each month and allow
Complainant-1 to keep approximately $3,000 a month, which was
just enough money to pay rent on her apartment.

xiv. By this time, Complainant-1 was entirely dependent on McEnaney
for money. Complainant-1 was unable to maintain a steady job due
to the demanding schedule McEnaney required to service
DiMenna. Complainant-1 was also unable to reenroll in college in
New York and worked for McEnaney full time.

xv. In addition to Complainant-1, McEnaney was advertising and
pimping other women using the Eros website. Complainant-1
approximates that a total of six other women were being pimped
by McEnaney before, during, and after the time period 2012
through 2017. Complainant-1 identified Lisa Porter, aka “Dakota
Martie,” as one of the women working for McEnaney. On multiple
occasions, Complainant-1 and Lisa Porter would do “doubles”
with DiMenna, meaning they were both required to have sex with

him at the same time. Complainaat=t also knew of iiworman

because the sessions became too physically and emotionally
demanding. Complainant-1 also worked with another woman,
“Lauren,” who accompanied Complainant-1 to Florida on at least
two occasions for “doubles” with DiMenna.

xvi. During her time working for Steven McEnaney, McEnaney
informed Complainant-1 that he kept hard drives that contained
copies of the nude images of the women he advertised online.
Complainant-1 additionally believes that McEnaney placed hidden
cameras at the work apartment where Complainant-1 would host
in-alls. MeBnaney told Complainant that Lisa Porter had been
raped» by»avclientvand»asvaresult, McEnaney installed hidden
cameras in the work apartments to ‘protect the women’ and have
the ability to blackmail clients in the event something
compromising occurred.

xvii, Complainant left McEnaney's organization around March
2017. Complainant-1 and McEnaney continued to communicate
by email, including conversations about Complainant-1 investing

cursory inspection of all messages, records, and images within any electronic devices found within
the TARGET PREMISES. Although law enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly
including the use of keyword searches, I know that keyword searches and similar methods typically
are inadequate to detect all responsive information. For example, keyword searches work only for
text data, yet many types of files commonly stored on phones include emails, including
attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and videos that do not store data as searchable text.
Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon to capture all relevant text data as it is
impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases investigative subjects will use in
their communications. Consequently, there often are many communications that ate responsive
and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword that law enforcement personnel
are likely to know in advance to search for.

For purposes of the requirement that a search warrant be executed within ten days as mandated
by C-P.L. Section 690.30(1), that with respect to the electronic devices seized pursuant to the
execution of this warrant, the warrant be deemed executed upon the transportation and receipt of
the electronic devices at a forensic analysis laboratory or facility, and that further analysis of these
items be permitted for any reasonable time thereafter in order to complete a thorough search
pursuant to this warrant. Once an electronic device is analyzed pursuant to the respective warrant,
the data, information and images contained therein will not change, and thus no greater intrusion
will result from a thorough search being conducted within a reasonable time.

In addition, based on the above, I request:

a. for evidentiary purposes that this Court grant authorization for law enforcement personnel,
including members of HTAU to photograph, process, analyze, test, and in any way scientifically
process the TARGET PREMISES and the devices found therein;

b. with respect to the stored electronic communications, data, information and images contained in
hard drive and other data storage devices and media described above, this Court grant permission
to search and retrieve the above described communications, data, information and images, and
print them or otherwise reproduce them by converting them or copying them into storage in
another device;

c. that the Court authorize the retrieval of the above-described information by printing said data,
information and communications or otherwise reproducing them by converting them or copying
them into storage in another device,

d. that the Court authorize specialists assigned to HTAU to assist in accessing, downloading,
retrieving, printing, copying and otherwise seizing the information described above.

It is also requested that the Court authorize a search of all files and data stored in electronic
devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored. In the event that data, information, or images evidencing passwords; as described
above, are found during said search, it is requested that authorization be granted to use said
passwords to search any and all encrypted files/containers on any recovered devices pursuant to
this search warrant for the evidence described above.

16. For all these reasons, there is reasonable cause to believe that the described evidence of the Subject
Crime will be found within the TARGET PREMISES and within any electronics devices found therein.

17. Furthermore, I am seeking to seize, search, and remove from the TARGET PREMISES any
computets as defined in Penal Law Section 156.00(1), as well as cellular telephones, cameras, video-
recorders, video console games and other electronic devices capable of storing data, information and
images. Because such devices are readily capable of storing data, information and images, it is
reasonable to believe that any such devices located in the target premises may contain evidence of the
crimes under investigation and sought by this warrant application. Neither I, nor my fellow officers
assigned to my unit, have the training and expertise in forensic computer analysis to conduct a
thorough and complete forensic search of computers, cellular telephones and/or other electronic
storage devices located in the target premises. I am therefore requesting that the Court authorize the
New York County District Attorney’s Office High Technology and Analysis Unit, and other New
York County District Attorney’s Office personnel, who, by their training and experience in computer
forensic analysis, are qualified to assist in the execution of this warrant, and the New York City Police
Department’s Computer Crime Squad'to assist me in accessing, downloading, extracting, retrieving,
printing, copying, and otherwise seizing the computerized and electronic data from any recovered
electronic devices. In addition, it is also requested that this Court grant permission to retrieve the
above-described data, information, and images, and print them or otherwise reproduce them by
converting them or copying them into storage in another device. It is also requested that the Court
authorize a search of all files and data stored in computers, cellular telephones, and other electronic
storage devices, irrespective of how the data is filed, labeled, designated, encrypted, hidden, disguised or
otherwise stored.

18. In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various methods to locate evidence,
fruits, and instrumentalities of the Subject Crimes, including but not limited to undertaking a cursory
inspection of all messages, records, and images within the electronic devices. Although law
enforcement may use other methods as well, particularly including the use of keyword searches, I
know that keyword searches and similar methods typically are inadequate to detect all responsive
information. For example, keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files
commonly stored on phones include emails, including attachments, scanned documents, pictures, and
videos that do not store data as searchable text. Moreover, keyword searches cannot be relied upon
to capture all relevant text data as it is impossible to know in advance all the unique words or phrases
investigative subjects will use in their communications. Consequently, there often are many
communications that are responsive and relevant to an investigation that do not contain any keyword
that law enforcement personnel are likely to know in advance to search for.

19, I am further informed by the attached affidavit of David L. Chan, Deputy Director of the New
York County District Attorney’s High Technology Analysis Unit (HTAU), that based upon his
training and experience, a thorough search and review of the data contained within any seized
electronic devices cannot be completed within 10 days. Searching electronic storage or communication
devices often requires that the search be completed by a qualified person in a laboratory or other
controlled environment because of the volume of evidence and technical requirements of the forensic
examination. Informant Chan further states that the examination of any electronic storage or

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

Plaintiff
ATTORNEY AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT
OF THE MOTION
v. Indictment Number: 70297-2022
STEVEN MCENANEY
Defendant

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the
following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes
them to be true:
ve I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
3. This affidavit is in support of the Defendant’s Motion to withdraw his plea of guilty
pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3) for ineffective assistance of counsel

pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 6

of the New York State Constitution. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; N.Y. CONST. art. I, § 6.

SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

4. In this case there was no investigation whatsoever by prior Counsel. The lack of an
investigation resulted in the failure of Counsel to ascertain the facts in this case. There

cannot be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary plea if the Counsel fails, at the least, to

Case No.

learn the basic facts that established reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant
committed a crime. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel,
because prior Counsel never made a motion to obtain a redacted version of the grand jury
minutes: in effect, that amounts to a failure to investigate the essential facts that formed
the basis of the indictment. Those basic facts could form the predicate information for a

motion to dismiss the indictment based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The

for a lot of stuff. There is no support in the record that indicates any animus from the
Court towards the Defendant, unless the aforementioned remarks were made to prior
Counsel, when prior Counsel had an off the record meeting — with the Judge and the
Assistant District Attorney — without the Defendant being present, and against the
Defendant’s wishes where substantive issues where discussed. Mr. McEneney had a right

to be present at said meeting: he had “peculiar knowledge that would [have been] ...

grand jury minutes. The Defendant was prejudiced, because he entered a guilty plea
without receiving the effective assistance of counsel.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The United States Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test for determining

Page 5 of 16

## Page 6

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 PI

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

when a Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel has

been violated. Under the two-pronged test it must first be shown “that counsel’s

representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing

professional norms.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).

Second, a “[d]efendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A

reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the

outcome.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). See also

People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y .3d 284, 56 N.Y.S.3d 275 (2017).

6. Pursuant to Article I, § 6 of the New York State Constitution, the Court of Appeals has
“adopt[ed] a rule somewhat more favorable to defendants.” People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d
476, 480, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154 (2005). In the State of New York, effective assistance of
counsel “has long been whether the defendant was afforded ‘meaningful representation.””
People v. Henry, 95 N.Y.2d 563, 565, 721 N.Y.S.2d 577 (2000), quoting People v.
Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d 708, 712, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998); see People v. Baldi, 54
N.Y.2d 137, 147, 444 N.Y.S.2d 893 (1981) and People v. Saunders, 193 A.D.3d 766, 145
N.Y.S.3d 121 (2"! Dept. 2021).

a. The New York State standard of meaningful representation “does not require a
defendant to fully satisfy the prejudice test of Strickland, although we continue to
regard a defendant’s showing of prejudice as a significant but not indispensable
element in assessing meaningful representation.” People v. Caban, 5 N.Y.3d 143,

155-156, 800 N.Y.S.2d 70 (2005) quoting People v. Stultz, 2 N.Y.3d 277, 284,

778 N.Y.S.2d 431 (2004) (internal quotes omitted). In the State of New York, any
prejudice component focuses on the “fairness of the process as a whole rather than
its particular impact on the outcome of the case.” People v. Benevento, 91 N.Y.2d
708, 714, 674 N.Y.S.2d 629 (1998).

b. The Court of Appeals has also noted that even though a conscious decision by a
defense attorney to act or not to act in a certain way, in a certain instance, may be
characterized as a “strategy” or “‘tactic,” that conscious decision may still not
amount to an “objectively reasonable and legitimate trial strategy under the
circumstances and evidence presented.” People v. Berroa, 99 N.Y.2d 134, 138,
753 N.Y.S.2d 12, (2002). The fact that a purposeful position taken by Counsel can
be regarded as “strategy” does not insulate a Court from making a determination
that ultimately characterizes the attorney’s actions as ineffective representation.
“[(U]nsupportable” and “harmful” strategies constitute ineffective assistance of
counsel, the same as no strategy at all. See People v. Bartley, 298 A.D.2d 160,
748 N.Y.S.2d 18 (1* Dept. 2002). As explained by (former Chief) Judge Korman
of the Eastern District:

[N]ot all strategic choices are sacrosanct. Merely labeling [defense
counsel]’s errors “strategy” does not shield his trial performance
from Sixth Amendment scrutiny ... [citations omitted]. To the
contrary, “certain defense strategies or decisions may be ‘so ill
chosen’ as to render counsel’s overall representation
constitutionally defective [citations omitted]. Quartararo v. Fogg,
679 F. Supp. 212, 247 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).

7. Under both federal law and New York State law, even an isolated error can easily amount

to ineffective assistance of counsel. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct.

“{a] single error may qualify as ineffective assistance, but only when the error is
sufficiently egregious and prejudicial as to compromise a defendant’s rights. (see People

argument that defendant waived the right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10,
1993 conviction of attempted assault in the second degree, because it was based on a
bargained plea of guilty, is without merit. Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was

nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth

ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order

probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would
have insisted on going to trial.”).
ARGUMENT, FACTS, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

9. The Defendant was arraigned on the Indictment on 9 March 2022: he was represented by
a public defender, or an attorney paid by the government, at his arraignment. The
Defendant is charged with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree (N.Y.
PENAL LAW § 230.25-1). Exhibit 1: Indictment.

10. | Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant’s NYSID report, the Defendant
has not had any prior contact with the criminal justice system.

11. The Defendant retained Mr. Richard Southard as his attorney on 1 November 2022.

12. ‘Mr. Southard provided ineffective assistance of counsel because Mr. Southard never
conducted an investigation of the facts in the case, prior Counsel never made a motion to

—_— scsiiemiatieniibimitaniens eee

Statute of Limitations; and, Mr. Southard never investigated the statue of limitations
claim, because he never made any effort to obtain the grand jury minutes. Upon
information and belief, that being Mr. Richard Southard, he never received the grand jury
minutes because of a Protective Order issued by the Court. Upon information and belief,
that being ADA Savino, he never turned over the grand jury minutes to defense counsel
because of a protective order issued by the Court. The four corners of the Protective
Order do not prevent access to the grand jury minutes. Exhibit 6 (Protective Order). And
even a liberal interpretation of the protective order — construing the order as preventing

Defense Counsel access to the grand jury minutes — was subject to appellate review based

Ls.

on the explicit language in the protective order.
The plea of the Defendant was not a knowing, intelligent voluntary plea of guilty because
the Defendant, and his attorney, were not provided with any sworn grand jury testimony
that the grand jury used to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence to
support the charges, or reasonable cause to believe that the Defendant committed the
crime. Prior Counsel never took any action to obtain the grand jury minutes.
The names and addresses of the witnesses is not necessary for an attorney to evaluate the
evidence as it related to the case against the Defendant. Based on the record, the Court
never entered an Order denying the Defense access to the grand jury minutes. And even if
the Court had entered a Protective Order with regard to the release of the grand jury
minutes, prior Counsel failed to make any type of written motion to challenge that
determination.
The record is devoid of any effort by Mr. Southard to obtain the grand jury minutes to
begin to investigate — less lone make — a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute
of limitations had expired. The Defendant’s attorney filed an Omnibus Motion in this
case on or about 31 January 2023. Exhibit 2: Defense Omnibus Motion. In the Notice of
Motion, prior Counsel moved for the following relief:
a. A Motion for Discovery pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.
Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law was repealed effective 1 January 2020.
bi In section II of the Omnibus Motion, former Counsel moved for discover pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 240.40. The statute was repealed effective 1

January 2020 and replaced by Article 245 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Cc. In prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion, Prior Counsel made numerous other requests
for discovery pursuant to repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

d. In section VII (2) of the omnibus motion, prior Defense Counsel requested release
of the grand jury minutes pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 210.30 (3).
Grand Jury minutes are automatically disclosed — absent a protective order —

pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.20 (1) (b).

€. Prior Counsel also filed a demand for discovery pursuant to various sections of
repealed Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

16. Prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion does not contain an application to dismiss the
Indictment on the grounds that this action was not commenced within the Statute of
Limitations. N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1) (f); 30.10. The Defense never
received the grand jury minutes so that a determination could be made as to whether a
motion to dismiss the Indictment — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 210.20 (1)
(f), and N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 30.10 — should have been filed.

a. People v. Harris, 26 N.Y.3d 321, 328, 22 N.Y.S.3d 393, 397-98 (2015) (“Claims
such as defendant's, presenting a clear-cut, objectively unreasonable failure by
counsel to obtain the dismissal of a time-barred count, instance precisely the sort
of breakdown in the adversary process understood in Strickland to be the
quintessential ground for and target of an ineffective assistance claim (Strickland

v Washington, 466 US at 696). And, under Strickland, it is irrelevant that the

omission is not ‘completely dispositive’ of the entire case. All a defendant must
show is ‘that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [6] would have been different’
(id. at 694 [emphasis added]). It is obvious that this standard is met where an
attorney unaccountably allows the submission of a time-barred count for which
his client is convicted.”),

b. People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 481, 806 N.Y.S.2d 154, 157 (2005) (“The
ultimate issue here is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to
argue that trial counsel was ineffective. That question depends on whether trial
counsel was clearly ineffective, and that question in turn depends on how strong
defendant's statute of limitations defense was. We conclude that it was a winning
argument; that trial counsel could not reasonably have thought that the defense
was not worth raising; that appellate counsel could not reasonably have thought
that she should not argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and that therefore an
‘egregious and prejudicial’ error, rising to the level of ineffective assistance, has
occurred.”’).

17. The Prosecution in their response to the prior Defense Counsel’s Omnibus Motion states
that “The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s
possession, custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The
People are aware of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to ‘make a diligent good faith

effort to ascertain the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL §

245.20(1) where it exists but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery
under the timelines established in CPL § 245.20(1).” Exhibit 3: Prosecution Response to
prior Counsel’s Omnibus Motion.

18. The Court issued a decision on the Omnibus Motion on 23 February 2023. Exhibit 4:
Decision and Order. There is no mention of discovery: (1) the Prosecution in their papers
claimed that they had fulfilled all of their discovery obligations, and (2) the Defense did
not utilize the statutory process — pursuant to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW §§ 245.30 (3) or
245.35 to obtain any discovery. There was no waiver of discovery, in this case, pursuant
to N.Y. CRIM. PROC. LAW § 245.75.

19. The failure to provide discovery — in and of itself — is not a basis for setting aside a
conviction; however, the failure toobtain the grand jury minutes so that the Defense can
put on a effective defense amounts to ineffective assistance of counsel.

20. The Assistant District Attorney, and prior Defense Counsel, both claim that the Court
issued a protective order denying the defense access to the grand jury. However, this is
belied by the facts in this case.

21. Based on present Defense’s Counsel review of the court file, there are no Defense written
motions filed requesting, or responding to request, for a protective order. On 12 April
2023, the Prosecution made an oral argument for a protective order. Exhibit 5: Court
Minutes. The Court issued a Protective Order; however, the Order did not prevent
Defense Counsel from obtaining the grand jury minutes to find out what evidence was the
basis\for the indictmentiim'thisicase. Exhibit 6: Protective Order. And to the extent that

prior Counsel may have construed that Order as prohibiting access to the grand jury

minutes, prior Counsel did not file a written response opposing the Prosecution’s
application, and prior Counsel did not appeal the Court’s protective order.

22. | Upon information and belief, that being Mr. McEneney, Mr. Southard was meeting with
the District Attorney, and the Court, against the Defendant’s wishes, and the Defendant
was not present. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, Mr. McEneney
informed prior Counsel that he wanted to be present at any meeting between the Court
and the Prosecution, along with his Defense Attorney. Under New York State law, Mr.
McEneney has a right to be present at a criminal proceeding where he is a Defendant, if
he might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the Defendant’s
position, or countering the Prosecution’s position. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with
attached e-mails. People v. Sprowal, 615 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331; 84 N.Y.2d 113, 118 (1994),
People v. Dokes, 584 N.Y.S.2d 761, 764, 79 N.Y.2d 656, 660 (1992), and People v.
Morales, 591 N.Y.S.2d 825, 829, 80 N.Y.2d 450, 456 (1992). The Defendant’s input
would be even more important in a case where the Defense has not factual information
related to the evidence that was present to the grand jury to support the charges in this
case.

23. Upon information and belief, that being the Defendant, the Defendant stated in his

ffidavit t _ { told him that the Judge hated hi { that the Jud
to put him away for a lot of stuff. Exhibit 7: Defendant’s Affidavit with attached e-mails
to prior Counsel. However, based on the court minutes from 12 April 2023, the Court had
no animus toward the Defendant. Prior Counsel’s interpretation of the Judge’s disposition

towards the Defendant is not supported by the record. Comments directed towards the

Defendant — by prior Counsel — such as those stated above, served no strategic purpose

except to scare and coerce the Defendant into pleading guilty.

24. This is a case where the Defendant pled guilty, and the prior Defense Attorney conducted
no investigation whatsoever in the case.

a. See e.g., Woodard v. Collins, 898 F.2d 1027, 1029 (Sth Cir. 1990) (First, a court
generally must strongly presume that counsel has exercised reasonable
professional conduct. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 and Samples,
897 F.2d at 196. No such presumption, however, is warranted when a lawyer
advises his client to plea bargain to an offense which the attorney has not
investigated. Such conduct is always unreasonable.”), and

b. Smith v. Mahoney, 611 F.3d 978, 986-87 (9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that Smith's
defense attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness
because he failed to investigate the facts of the crime, failed to investigate Smith's
mental state at the time of the crime, and failed to discuss possible defenses before
Smith pled guilty...... Smith's intent to plead guilty mitigated, but did not
eliminate, his attorney's duty to reasonably investigate. See Langford v. Day, 110
F.3d 1380, 1386-87 (9th Cir. 1996). Despite Smith's insistence on pleading guilty,
his defense attorney failed to adequately investigate the circumstances of the
crime.”).

CONCLUSION
Defendant McEnaney has been denied effective assistance of Counsel under the United

States Constitution, and under the New York State Constitution. The federal standard, under the

Page 15 of 16

## Page 16

FILED: NEW YORK SUPREME COURT - CRIMINAL TERM (EDDS) 02/02/2024 07:57 Pt

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, has been violated because prior “counsel’s
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing
professional norms;” and, but for'prior Counsel's unprofessional errors, Defendant McEnaney
would not have pled guilty. The Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of counsel
pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New York State Constitution, because the Defendant was
not afforded “meaningful representation.” The Defendant’s plea of guilty was not a knowing,
intelligent, voluntary plea of guilty, because he did not receive effective assistance of Counsel.

. WHEREFORE, the Defendant respectfully asks that this Court exercise its’ discretion
and allow the Defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty — in this case — because the Defendant
was not provided with effective assistance of counsel pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the New
York State Constitution; and, the Defendant was not provided with effective assistance of
Counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
Il. DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda y. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

location when the warnings were given. Also, state whether such defendant or co-conspirator
requested a lawyer. If so, the time and location of such request and to whom such request was made;
also, include any written, recorded or oral statement of the defendant made to a private citizen that the

People intend to offer at trial either on their direct case or on cross-examination of defendant.

2. Any transcript of testimony relating to the criminal action or pending against the defendant, given
by the defendant, or any agent or employee of the defendant (or by any co-defendant whether charged

or not) before any grand jury or other proceeding;

3. All statements of witnesses and/or any notes concerning such statements made by any law
enforcement officer, including but not limited to, any physical description of the alleged perpetrator,
the names of the witnesses providing descriptions, the names of law enforcement officers to whom
they were provided, and the date, time and location where such description was given and any reports

or documents relating to such description;

5. If the defendant was viewed or observed by any witness other than a law enforcement officer at

any stage of the proceedings, the name and address of the witness and the circumstances under which

the observations took place;

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

1. Pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963),
defendant requests that the prosecution provide all information, in whatever form available, supporting
the position that the defendant did not commit the crime(s) charged, including but not limited to:

a. Any record of previous arrests or convictions or any other evidence or information demonstrating
participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",
police personnel records, or other memoranda; see People v. Pressley, 234 A.D.2d 954, 652 N.Y.S.2d

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE,

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack
of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v, Lopez, 84 N.¥.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to
grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result
of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:
3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain

location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In

addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time

the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People y.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the
defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

b. The warrant with which the property was seized was issued without probable cause. Other than

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence
of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a
safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the

defendant.

Case No. Indictment Number 70297-2022

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s
likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v, Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v, Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of a prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is

## Page 34

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to
CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s
charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to
Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support
thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury
testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

ACTS

defendant requests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest record, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of
such information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence
the prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attorney supplies the
defendant's criminal record, as well as a list of any of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious,
or immoral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant to CPL 240.43

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of
defendant's Division of Criminal Justice Services report to enable defendant to prepare for a Sandoval

hearing.

X. MOTION FOR HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MOTIONS
1. Should the Court not grant any of the relief requested above at the time these motions are
argued, I request that the Court schedule hearings relating to the same so that the defendant may have

an opportunity to produce evidence in support of the relief requested.

2. More specifically, the defendant requests the following hearings:

a. Mapp,
b. Sandoval

3. I request that any hearing ordered and had in this case, with the exception of a Sandoval

hearing, be held at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of trial in order to allow

sufficient time for the transcription of the minutes of such hearings.

for relief, based upon the information that is now available to me. I request that the Court grant me
leave to submit subsequent motions, should facts discovered through this motion or hearings related to
this motion, indicate that additional relief may be warranted. Moreover, should additional specific
allegations of fact be necessary to support any of the requests herein, defendant asks for leave to

supplement this motion as necessary.

5. Subject to the resolution of the aforesaid motions, defendant reserves the right to speedily

move to suppress any other unlawfully seized evidence upon discovery of facts relating thereto.

Defendant further requests the reservation of the right to request an adjournment after pre-trial hearings

to investigate information developed at said hearings pursuant to People v, Peacock, 31 NY2d 907.
Granting such other and further relief as this court deems just and proper.

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
-against- DEFENDANT’S
OMNIBUS MOTION

STEVEN MCENANEY,
IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and
am familiar with its facts.
2. This affirmation is submitted in response to the defendant’s omnibus motion in

which the defendant seeks inspection of the grand jury minutes and the dismissal of the

indictment, a bill of particulars, pretrial discovery, suppression of physical evidence

recovered pursuant to a search warrant, a Sandoval hearing, and in support of the People's

request for reciprocal discovery.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was propertly instructed on the law, and that the

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“[a] bill of
particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device”). Accordingly,
defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within” our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the

defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huniley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
9. The People intend to offer at trial certain tangible evidence that was recovered during
a search warrant execution at the defendant’s residence, 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point, New
York 12578. During the search, a large trunk and banker’s box was recovered from the
defendant’s home. The trunk contained numerous BDSM items, sex toys, lingerie, and other
items used for sex work. The banker’s box included similar items and also an envelope

containing a letter and materials the defendant prepared to intimidate and threaten a witness

in this case. Finally, a laptop was recovered that contained sexually explicit materials that

further support the charge that the defendant operated a high-end prostitution enterprise
from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search warrant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,
unreliable information. The warrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from
Complainant-1, as to why probable cause existed to believe the defendant’s primary
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012.
While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant
to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient
reasonable cause to believe the defendant maintained dominion and control over the
residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
wattant application are not the type of possessions that the defendant would share, explain

or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

12. The items sought in the warrant were of a nature that the defendant took great care
in concealing from the women in his organization, including hidden camera footage, laptops
and photographic evidence that could be used to extort or blackmail the women. The
warrant application explained this in great detail and was based on probable cause and
common-sense conclusions that can be drawn from the facts. It is important to note that
many of the items the People sought to locate were indeed found in the defendant’s
residence, including the items listed in paragraph 9.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the
defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the
trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the

credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(b).

PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the
Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4. The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant’s residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant, This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently particularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
Stale.

4, The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

1 We are also requesting that once disclosed, the

2 information and materials be kept in defense counsel's sole

4 also requesting that the defendant only review the material

6 or disclose any of the information. And, finally,

7 prohibiting any person who receives the information from

8 posting any of the information on a multitude of social media

10 We have already provided defense counsel with all

14 witnesses who identities you are seeking to protect, have you
15 provided him with the substance of those statements as well
16 as a way to identify witness one and the attribution of those
17 statements, for example.

19 THE COURT: And why is that?
20 MR. SAVINO: The majority of the evidence that we
21 are seeking to withhold is e-mail content that was received

9 MR. SAVINO: As I just mentioned I filed and served

10 the discovery list. So, défense) counsel now has)voluminous

11 bank records which record the proceeds the defendant received

13 records, apartment leasing records, all the photographs and
14 inspecting documents recovered from a search warrant at the
15 defendant's home.

16 Also extractions from the District Attorney's

17 Office HTAU Unit on the devices recovered, the investigative
18 reports from the human trafficking investigators and most
19 importantly all of the G-mail records and e-mails that were
20 associated with the defendant's multiple e-mail addresses.
21 These are all received through search warrants. The

22 defendant also has records for one of the primary clients,
23 Joseph Demena.

24 So, these are e-mail search warrant returns that
25 span over six years, and e-mail responses between dozens of

1 different parties. This is all in the defendant's

2 possession. That would be more than enough to prepare for

3 trial.

4 As I mentioned, the evidence is very e-mail heavy

S and the defendant has all of his e-mail addresses and all

6 these e-mails, as well as the client, Joseph Demena.

7 Defendant has notes from his proffer session where he

8] admitted to organizing, recruiting, facilitating, managing

9 and profiting from prostitution.
10 The People believe the factors outlined in CPL
11 245.70 support a good cause showing for the Protective Order.
12 The defendant is charged with Criminally Promoting
13 Prostitution in the Third Degree.
14 This was a prostitution organization that had very
1s high-end clientele with wealthy clients paying thousands of
16 dollars per date, and often times had unlimited access to the
17 women the defendant trafficked.
18 Based on the e-mail returns that I mentioned, the
19 defendant planned the dates, told the women where to go, then
20 received thousands of dollars, almost on a weekly basis, for
21 his cut. The clients, particularly Joseph Demana, were
22 anything but normal. They were often sadistic and physically
23 abusive and the defendant even built a sex dungeon in an
24 apartment in Midtown, complete with a crucifix like structure
25 so that clients could act out their warped sexual desires.

1 The evidence from the e-mail returns also shows

2 chat when the women would complain of the intense physical

3 toll, which included anal probing with gynecological tools,

4 electroshock treatment and flogging with whips and other

S devices, the defendant essentially told the women to suck it
6 up because they were making so much money. And this lasts

7 for almost six years.

8 I believe there is legitimate concern that should
9 the witnesses' information be turned over before the start of
10 trial, measures will be taken to intimidate or harm the

ae witnesses.

12 I went through a number of these in the partial
13 ex-parte motion with Your Honor, which included an exhibit

14 that we discovered when the defendant was arrested.
15 He essentially had an envelope that was an
16 extortion packet for one of the people that will be a witness
17 in this trial. And this was complete with letters,

18 surveillance photographs that were taken of this person,

19 which included threats and other potential consequences,

20 should they continue to go forward, which was a separate

21 matter at the time, but also would be part of this case.

22 The defendant's e-mails going back for years also
23|| show how he manipulated and controlled the various women. He
24 had access to their e-mail accounts, keys to their

25 apartments, and knew intimate details about their lives.

1 I believe now that the defendant is facing prison
2 time, measures could be sought to intimidate or harass them,
i) as well as to call into question their safety.
4 Finally, I believe the utility of the information
5 which is sought to be withheld is outweighed by the risk of
6 exposure and potential harm and intimidation to those
7 witnesses.
8 I mentioned the defendant has troves of discovery
) already, including the e-mails, and the defendant's prior
10 statements.
nla Given the nature of these charges, the defendant's
12 conduct throughout the Indictment period, risk to the
13 witnesses and the defendant's interest in harming or
14 intimidating them, outweighs the disclosure of their names,
15 contact information and other identifying information.
16 THE COURT: Thank you.
17 I'll hear from you, Mr. Southard.
18 MR. SOUTHARD: Your Honor, defense seeks full
£9 disclosure of the identities of the names of the witnesses,
20 and the statements of witnesses. In the alternative, we seek
ZL that the redactions be directed to be as minimally invasive
22 as necessary to protect the witnesses' identity, but not to
23 obliterate any semblance of what the evidence is.

1 completely blacked out. So, what Your Honor sees in support
2 of the affirmation, I'm seeing blank pages.
3 THE COURT: I understand, and there was a reason
4 for that, but I do understand your point, counsel.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: And that was the case with the
6 search warrant application. And when I was a prosecutor we
7 were taught to redact as little as possible to balance the
8 interests of the government, but also to protect the identity
9 of the witness.
10 Here we haven't been provided, as Your Honor has
11 inquired, with even some of the statements of the witnesses.
a And why that is important is because this is a case where the
13 impeachment of the witnesses is going to be very important
14 because there is a vast difference between the role that my
15 client has even proffered to, and what the state is now
16 claiming his role is.
17 So, a lot of this information about, he's ina
18 position where he is the only one that has exclusivity to
19 their accounts and e-mails and all this stuff, is a fact in
20 dispute.
21 The fact he's being paid 25 percent for their
22 dates with their sugar daddies is a fact in dispute, but I
23 need to know what the statements are so we can prepare for
24 them, and not on the eve of trial with a sole practitioner
25 who has hundreds of thousands of text messages to go through.

THE COURT: I get it.

This case has been on, and he's never intimidated
or spoken to anyone. The Court of Appeals has said, merely
asserting that a witness could be harmed and intimidated
without evidence to support it, in People versus - -

1 thinking is at this time, counsel, is that the People should
2 turn over to the Court the witness statements with their
3 proposed redactions and I will review them, and I'll see what
4 can be disclosed to the defense at this time.
5 MR. SOUTHARD: Any reason, Your Honor, why the
6 defense can't see those, or either be provided with them. I
7 have had cases where I kept it in my file in sealed
8 envelopes.
9 THE COURT: I understand that. I think at this
10 time, since we are not yet quite close to trial, based upon
11 the showing made by the People, they have established good
12 cause for the issuance of the Protective Order in the form
13 that they have proposed.
14 And based on their showing that establishes that
Lo there is, based on the nature and circumstances of the crimes
16 charged, that there is a danger to the safety of the
17 witnesses, risk of intimidation and harassment, and the
18 reduced likelihood of witness cooperation with law
19 enforcement now and in the future, I find they have
20 established a basis for withholding that information at this
21 time, until the commencement of jury selection.
22 Now, once we have a firm trial date established I
23 may revise that ruling and require the People to turn over
24 that information well in advance of trial, to give you
25 sufficient time to look at it. It may be an order that is

for attorney's eyes only, at that point in time.

But I think right now, since we have not set a
firm trial date, there are no hearings in this case, so as
soon as you have been given all of the discovery that you are
entitled to, subject to the issuance of this Protective
Order, you will be given a chance to move to strike the
Certificate of Compliance.

I will rule, and you will file your defense
Certificate of Compliance, then we'll set a date for trial.
Well in advance of that trial date I will consider, seriously
consider, revising that order and requiring the People to
provide it to you, at least some of that information.

MR. SOUTHARD: I understand.

THE COURT: So, Mr. Savino, I would like you to get
me, within two weeks, the documents with the proposed
redactions so that I can review them. And after that they
can be turned over to the defense. If I have questions I may
ask you to go on the record and defend those redactions to
me.

So, the Protective Order hearing was really the
next Court date here. I don't think we need to be back in
Court before May 4th.

Is that a good date?

COURT CLERK: Yes.

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine.

MR. SOUTHARD: One more matter.

When I had first taken over the case, since the
People have not made any offer in the case whatsoever, I
asked if Your Honor would consider probation. You said you
hadn't read the Grand Jury minutes.

THE COURT: But now I have. So, the answer is no
at this time.

MR. SOUTHARD: Would Your Honor be amenable to my -
- since we have this time now - - would Your Honor be
amenable to my preparing a pre-pleading memorandum?

THE COURT: I will consider that.

What is the People's position? Where are you in
terms of any offer or recommendation?

MR. SAVINO: We have not made an official
recommendation, but we are not going along with probation at
this time.

THE COURT: So, this appears to be an E Felony.

MR. SAVINO: D Felony.

THE COURT: All right.

1 MR. SAVINO: Maximum, I believe, is two and a half

5 I'm not going to offer a probation plea based on

present at all proceedings regarding my case, Mr. Southard did not have my permission to

meet with the Judge and the District Attorney without me being present.

When I found out from Mr. Southard that he had meet with the Judge, and the
District Attorney, to discuss the case without me being present, I asked what
happened. Mr. Southard told me that the Judge hated me, and that the Judge wants
to put me away for a lot of stuff. Mr, Southard also said that he talked to the Judge
about excluding everything related to Mr. Joe DiMenna, and that the Judge cut
him off and said “Ict’s talk about jail time.” Mr. Southard also said that they
discussed plea bargaining in the conference.

not for me.

9. Mr. Southard and J rarcly had any discussions about the case. He was always very hard to

Richard,

| went through your motion. | do not understand how this motion could have been submitted without you having all the

evidence al your disposal or an affidavit from me. My Brady rights are being trampled not only by attorney incompetence

but the protective order. If! have NO access to my emails, do not know who Is accusing me of salacious garbage (most

of which has already besn disproven) how do | gather evidence to defend myself? | will be extremely behind the 8 ball if ‘
this goes to trial. | didn't pay you 26k to pull me aside 2 minutes before a hearing and ask me If I'm willing to destroy my

life with my son, sanctuary and everything { worked for. To.date you have not.asked me a question about anything

involving my case or evidence you have seen. | offerad up witnesses on my behalf who can counter the narrative the

ADA took from Joseph Fan and Ashelelgh Scott. | have not been able to have my volce heard aside from telling bits and

pleces during the proffer In-between hearing the word fuck saw 500 tImes, Here are some glaring Issues you may or may

not be aware of. The ADA had not disclosed (unless something not opened yet) evidence pertaining to :

- BRADY (1) f.g, h and I.

- Atleast 1 of their witnesses (Ashelgh Scott) has been pald to the best of my knowledge (NDA needs to see daylight
and probably one of the things they have within the protective order)

- Joseph Fan referred to Ashleigh as crazy on the recording in NY and also says she had a mental breakdown from
alcohol, drugs and her gender Issues. After all of this started my friend Alex (whose) bullding she rented in told me a
bunch of instances where neighbors called the cops on her and she almost blew the bullding up by leaving the gas on, It
is thought she was trying to kill herself. Fire department was called and they almost broke the door down.

- I question if there has beén any Considération to wifriessés arid or thréuts rads by fhe ADA towards witiésses (no rie
has sald anything to me directly)

- (h) they need to disclose if they are going after Joe Dimeena. They certalnly were making threats at the proffer towards
him indirectly. As you mentioned, why is he not In cuffs or a co-conspirator If he Is such a monster.

we need to list everything we feel is missing from BRADY rights...specifically Itemized. This gets me to the next point.
Why have you still not seen all of the evidence? It Is a simple trip down the block to the ADA office? Best Buy is nota
reasonable place to open my case info.

These are all the things they are trying to cover with thelr protective order because thelr case becomes a mess of epic
proportions if they con keep it = | pe They a are also at oes fy ruining oo countless lives for what Is truly the equivalent to

What the Judge needs to hear Is the truth and not the narrative that the ADA took from Joseph Fan. They literally used the
same words as him during the proffer. Joseph Fan on tape says (the idea is to make Joe Dimenna “Look like a monster’.
can only imagine the crap the grand
Jury heard based on what was In warrants. 4

I do not see any reason for them to have e protective order. ail er adie Ae alt pall lel ot
think) until the time they indicted me. 1 had not spoken to anyone aside any 0} seen , Julie,
Sahiris, and Ksenia many times but nothing about anything was discussed, Since my Indictment | have seen Sahiris and
Julie. They are very concerned and Sahiris wants to make a statement. No one was ever threatened or coerced. Cindy

and Julie contacted me before they spoke to investigators asking what they should do. | told them to tell the truth.

We need to meet. | can not today because of the storm. Let me know when this order Is being argued. If It Is this week
we need fo sit down prior and have a well thought out ditection moving fonverd.

Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932) (‘It is hardly

necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded

a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice’). T he Government here agrees, as

it has previously, that ‘the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the right to be

represented by an otherwise qualified attorney whom that defendant can afford to hire, or

who is willing to represent the defendant even though he is without funds.’ Caplin &

Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624-625, 109 S. Ct. 2646, 109 S. Ct.

2667, 105 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1989).”) N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (b) (3),

Notwithstanding a client’s right to terminate his attorney, Court approval is still required

pursuant to N.Y. RULE OF PROF. CONDUCT R. 1.16 (d). In this case there is no

prejudice involved because the Defendant has entered a plea of guilty, and is awaiting

sentencing. This substitution of Counsel is no taking place on the eve of trial.

The Defendant would like to make a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to N.Y.

CRIM. PROC. LAW § 220.60 (3). See €.g., People v. Ladd, 220 A.D.2d 849, 850, 632

N.Y.S.2d 233, 235 (3 Dept. 1995). (“The People's argument that defendant waived the

right to challenge the constitutionality of his June 10, 1993 conviction of attempted

assault in the second degree, because it was based on a bargained plea of guilty, is

without merit, Defendant's plea of guilty on June 10, 1993 was not a waiver of his right to
claim ineffective assistance of counsel since “ ‘the Voluntariness of the plea depends on
whether counsel's advice “was within the range of competence demanded of attomeys in
criminal cases’” ( People v Ferguson, 192 AD2d 800, Iv denied 82 NY2d 717, quoting

-against- DECISION AND ORDER
Ind. No. 70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,
Defendant
nnn te. .6.).t 2 Se X

FELICIA A. MENNIN, AJSC::
Defendant’s omnibus motion is decided as follows:

1. The motion to inspect the Grand Jury minutes is granted. The motion to dismiss or reduce the indictment
for legal insufficiency of the evidence or defects in the proceedings is denied. The Court has inspected the

Grand Jury minutes and finds that they are legally sufficient to support the charges and that the proceedings
“were properly conducted.

2. The People do not intend to offer statements made by defendant to a law enforcement officer at trial and
therefore a Huntley hearing is not necessary.

3. The People do not intend to offer identification evidence at trial and therefore a Wade hearing is not
necessary.

4, The motion to suppress physical evidence recovered from the defendant's residence is denied. The
physical evidence was obtained upon execution of a search warrant which authorized a search of the target
premises. The defendant has moved to controvert the warrant. This Court has examined the warrant materials
and finds that reasonable cause was sufficiently established to justify the warrant’s issuance by the magistrate.
CPL 690.10(2); People v. Tambe, 71 NY2d 492 [1988]. The information given by the affiant detective provided
reasonable cause to believe that evidence of the alleged crimes were being kept at the target premises. The
warrant sufficiently pafticularized the place to be searched and what was to be seized. The information was not
stale. -

4. The Sandoval and Ventimiglia motions will be heard immediately before trial.

This shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

RETAINED COUNSEL

Vv. Indictment Number: 70297-2022

STEVEN MCENANEY

Lawrence P. LaBrew Esq., an attorney duly admitted to practice in the Courts of this
State, hereby swear under the penalty of perjury, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 2106, that the

following statements are true, and as to those made upon information and belief that he believes

them to be true:
1. I am the attorney for the Defendant Steven McEnaney.
Be The following addendum is being submitted to supplement the attorney affidavit that was

submitted in support of the motion after receiving the attached e-mail. See attached e-
mail.

3, Mr. McEnaney’s prior attorney was terminated by the client. Teichner v. W & J Holsteins

64 N.Y.2d 977, 979, 489 N.Y.S.2d 36, 37 (1985) (“A client has an absolute right to

discharge an attorney at any time.”).

4. The Defense also cites Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932). The facts

in Powell v. Alabama — as stated by the Court are as follows:

The petitioners, hereinafter referred to as defendants, are negroes charged
with the crime of rape, committed upon the persons of two white girls. The
crime is said to have been committed on March 25, 1931. The indictment
was returned in a state court of first instance on March 31, and the record

recites that on the same day the defendants were arraigned and entered
pleas of not guilty. There is a further recital to the effect that upon the
arraignment they were represented by counsel. But no counsel had been
employed, and aside from a statement made by the trial judge several days
later during a colloquy immediately preceding the trial, the record does not
disclose when, or under what circumstances, an appointment of counsel
was made, or who was appointed. During the colloquy referred to, the trial
judge, in response to a question, said that he had appointed all the
members of the bar for the purpose of arraigning the defendants and then
of course anticipated that the members of the bar would continue to help
the defendants if no counsel appeared. Upon the argument here both sides
accepted that as a correct statement of the facts concerning the matter.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 49, 53 S. Ct. 55, 57 (1932).

“Tt is hardly necessary to say that, the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should

be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S.

45, 53, 53 S. Ct. 55, 58 (1932).

5 In Powell v. Alabama the Court went on to say that “If in any case, civil or criminal, a
state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by
and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a
denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.” Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932).

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the


## Page 17

If you are not a United States citizen, a plea of guilty to any offense, a conviction by trial verdict, or a youthful
offender adjudication subjects you to a risk that adverse consequences will be imposed on you by the United States
immigration authorities, including, but not limited to, removal from the United States, exclusion from admission to the
United States, and/or denial of naturalization. Because the immigration consequences applicable in your particular
case may depend on factors such as your current immigration status, your length of residence in the United States, and
your previous criminal history, you should consult with your attorney for advice specific to your circumstances.

The following are designated as deportable offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2), and any non-citizen
convicted of such an offense (within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. § 1101[a][48]) “shall, upon order of the Attorney
General, be removed” (8 U.S.C. § 1227[a]), regardless of whether the offense is a felony, a misdemeanor, or any other
offense under State law:

. any controlled substance or marihuana offense (other than a first offense involving
possession for one’s own use of 30 grams or less of marihuana);

‘ any offense involving a firearm, any domestic violence offense or violation of an order of
protection, any stalking offense or crime of child abuse, and failure to register as a sex offender;

° any offense designated an “aggravated felony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), including, but
not limited to: murder; rape; any controlled substance or firearm trafficking offense; bail jumping;
burglary, robbery, receipt of stolen property, or any other theft-related offense or crime of violence
for which a sentence of one year or more is imposed; or any offense involving money laundering of
more than $10,000 or fraud, deceit or tax evasion in which the loss to the victim(s) is more than
$10,000; and

° many other offenses described in 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2).

In addition, if the offense constitutes an “aggravated felony,” or if you are not a lawful permanent resident of
the United States (or have not been such for at least five years with at least seven years’ continuous residency) and the
offense is any deportable offense, there will be additional consequences, including, but not limited to, your ineligibility
for discretionary cancellation of removal by the Attorney General.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAIVER OF RIGHT

TO APPEAL
-against-
Indictment No. IND-70297-22
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

I hereby waive my right to appeal from this judgment of conviction. I understand that the
right to appeal is separate and distinct from other rights automatically forfeited upon a plea of guilty,

such as the right to remain silent, the right to confront one’s accusers and the right to a jury trial.

I understand that I would ordinarily retain my right to appeal even after pleading guilty, but
in this case, in exchange for the disposition I have been offered, I agree to give up this right. I also
understand that by waiving my right to appeal, I am giving up the right to raise on appeal a number
of claims that I could otherwise raise even after a guilty plea. In particular, I understand that I am
waiving my right to ask the Appellate Division to review the terms of the plea and to reduce my
sentence on the ground that, although legal, the sentence is unduly harsh or severe. I also
understand that I am waiving my right to appeal the denial of any motion I made to suppress
evidence or to dismiss the case because the People were not ready for trial within the time period set
forth by statute (CPL 30.30).

I understand that this waiver does not apply to any of the four following issues: a
constitutional speedy trial claim; a challenge to the legality of the sentence promised by the judge; an

issue as to my competency to stand trial; or the voluntariness of this waiver.

I execute and sign this waiver knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily after being advised by
the Court and after consulting with my attorney, Richard Southard, standing beside me. I have had a
full opportunity to discuss these matters with my attorney and any questions I may have had have
been answered to my satisfaction. I have agreed to give up my appellate rights in exchange for a
favorable disposition of this case. «

SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK: PART 62

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).



## Page 4

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the
defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION
EVIDENCE
8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who
previously identified the defendant. A Wade hearing is therefore unnecessary.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO CONTROVERT A SEARCH WARRANT
& SUPPRESS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE


## Page 5

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

Complai babl istedmtombeli heedefendant’s»pri
residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012

While certain portions of the application provided to the defendant were redacted, pursuant

to a protective order, the Court will find that the application included more than sufficient

residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.



## Page 6

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the

defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).
‘ PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL
i DISCOVERY

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses

Lo

thereof of every alibi witness upon whom the defendant intends to rely to establish the

defendant’s presence elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.

Wherefore, it is respectfully requested that, except as consented to herein, the

defendant’s motion should be denied.

PLEA

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

Defendant.

Ind. No. 70297/2022

KEITH SAVINO, an attorney admitted to practice before the courts of this State,

affirms under penalty of perjury that:

1. Laman Assistant District Attorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office

and am assigned to the prosecution of the above-captioned case. I submit this affirmation and

memorandum of law in opposition to defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to
Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, PL § 230.25(1), under indictment 70297 /2022,
pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 220.60(3), on grounds that the defendant received
ineffective assistance of counsel during the pendency of the case.

2. Defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the
defendant’s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel does not provide a

legal basis for withdrawal and is not supported by the record. Furthermore, the defendant’s

statements and admissions during the plea allocution on October 12, 2023, clearly indicate

that the plea was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.

Z


## Page 3

3. This affirmation is made upon information and belief, the sources of which are the
Court records, the files maintained by the District Attorney’s Office, and conversations with
defendant’s defense counsels throughout this case, Glenn Hardy, James Nemia, Richard
Southard and Lawrence LaBrew.

FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
4. The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2022, and arraigned in Part 62 on an NA
indictment, charging him with one count of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, Penal
Law § 230.25(1). At his arraignment, the defendant was assigned 18(b) counsel, Glenn Hardy.
Since the sole count on the indictment was not bail-eligible, the defendant was released on his
own recognizance and ordered to surrender his passport.

5. The indictment was the result of a long-term investigation conducted by the New York
County District Attorney’s Office into the defendant’s prostitution enterprise, which spanned
from on or about May 1, 2012, to on or about January 19, 2018. The defendant operated a
lucrative, high-end prostitution service whereby he managed and profited from the sexual
services of women that worked for him. The defendant kept an exclusive list of clients, primarily
wealthy businessmen, and charged thousands of dollars per ‘date.’

6. The defendant recruited women primarily through the websites Backpage and Craigslist
and groomed them to work as prostitutes. During the recruitment process, the defendant

photographed the women to create personalized websites and online advertisements for sexual

services. The defendant had exclusive access to the websites and ads.


## Page 4

7. Initially, the women kept 75% of the hourly fees, with the other 25% retained by the

defendant. However, over time, the defendant would decrease the women’s eatnings until some

of the women became totally dependent upon him.

8. Over the years, most of the women cycled through a client, Joseph DiMenna, a wealthy
hedge fund manager, who maintained a monthly retainer with the defendant’s organization. This
retainer allowed DiMenna exclusive, unlimited access to the defendant’s women. The defendant
rented an apartment in Midtown East, located at 1026 2:4 Avenue, that served as the primary
‘work apartment,’ where the sex dates would occur. DiMenna, among other clients, was a
frequent visitor at the apartment, so much so that the defendant built him a ‘sex dungeon,’
complete with a cruciftx-style structure and human-size cage for DiMenna to act out his BDSM
sexual proclivities.

9. Throughout the course of the investigation, hundreds of thousands of emails were
obtained, through search warrants, which detailed the control and power the defendant wielded
overt the women. The defendant created email addresses for the women and communicated with

clients, pretending to be the women who would then go on ‘dates.’ The defendant managed the
‘date’ schedules and directed them on how to transfer him his percentage of the money. Payments

were always in cash and the women either gave the defendant his percentage directly or deposited

the money into the defendant’s bank account.

10. During sessions with Joseph DiMenna, multiple women complained to the defendant
about DiMenna’s rough behavior including flogging, nipple clamps, and use of painful sex toys.

The defendant brushed these concerns off as part of the business.

4


## Page 5

11. The investigation uncovered over a dozen women that worked for the defendant in his

prostitution organization from approximately May 2012 to January 2018. The defendant was NA

indicted and on March 9, 2022, investigators from the New York County District Attorney’s
Office arrested the defendant at his home in Dutchess County, NY. A seatch warrant was
executed at the defendant’s home. Investigators recovered two large travel trunks that contained
numerous sex toys, including dildos, anal probes, nipple clamps, and other paraphernalia.

12. Soon after his arraignment, the defendant retained James Nemia, a close family friend, to
represent him. On July 12, 2022, the defendant and Mr. Nemia came to the District Attorney’s
Office for a proffer. The defendant and his attorney signed a proffer agreement, and the
defendant was questioned by the assigned Assistant District Attorney and investigators. During
the proffer, oftentimes without direct questioning, the defendant admitted to all the conduct
underlying the charge of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree. The defendant admitted
to recruiting and photographing women, creating sex advertisements and websites, taking a
percentage of the money the women earned during sex dates, and managing their email addresses.
He also admitted to knowing Joseph DiMenna, but denied ever meeting him.

13. While the defendant refused to admit that his conduct constituted that of a pimp, he
otherwise admitted to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third Degree, including
knowingly advancing and profiting from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling, and
owning a prostitution business involving two or more persons for prostitution. The proffer

amounted to a full admission of all the charged conduct in the indictment.

14. On December 15, 2023, the defendant retained Richard Southard to represent him in this
case and Mr. Southard appeared with the defendant in Part 62. In January 2023, Mr. Southard
filed detailed omnibus motions, which were decided by this Court in a decision issued on
February 23, 2023. The People provided Mr. Southard with voluminous discovery, which
included financial records, hundreds of thousands of emails obtained through search warrants,
redacted versions of those search warrants, property records, and various other evidence. The
People also informed Mr. Southard of a Protective Order application that had been served on
ptior counsel, James Nemia, and provided Mr. Southard with a partially redacted version of that
Protective Order.

15. On April 12, 2023, this Court conducted a Protective Order hearing that addressed the
application filed by the People. After hearing additional oral arguments by the People and Mr.
Southard, this Court granted the People’s application for the Protection Order. As part of the
Order, the Court ruled that disclosure of the names and adequate contact information, as well as
other discoverable information and material that identified those witnesses, would be delayed
until the commencement of jury selection. Since testimony and evidence presented during the
gtand jury proceeding would identify the names of those witnesses, the grand jury minutes were
not disclosed to Mr. Southard, but would have been turned over prior to the commencement of
jury selection, per the Order.

16. On October 12, 2023, after lengthy plea negotiations, including a Microsoft Teams
conference between Judge Mennin, Mr. Southard, and the assigned Assistant District Attorney,

the defendant indicated he wished to plead guilty in this case with a promised sentence of a four-

onth jail, followed by five-years of probation. During the plea allocution, the defendant

of questions from Judge Mennin, along with a factually specific allocution by \

answered a litany

the People. See Exhibit 1.
Judge Mennin, the defendant answered the following

17. During the allocution with

questions:

a. “Have you had enough time to fully discuss your plea and sentence with your

attorney?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”

b. “Are you satisfied with the representation you have received from him?”

i. Answer: “Yes.”

c. “And are you pleading guilty to this charge because you ate in fact guilty?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
d. “Has anyone forced or threatened you to plead guiltyr”
i. Answer: “No.”
e. “Are you on any drugs, medication, ot alcohol today?”
i. Answer: “No.”
f. “So you fully understand what is happening here, correct?”
i. Answer: “Yes.”
See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 6-7.
18. The Court then asked the defendant, “Have any questions you may have had been
answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?” to which the defendant replied, “Yes.” Id. at

## Page 8

‘Pg. 8:9-11. Additionally, the Court asked the defendant, “Did you discuss with Mr. Southard how
you might defend the charges in this case?” and the defendant answered, “Yes.” Id. at pg. 9:18-
20. Finally, the defendant legally allocated to the elements of Promoting Prostitution in the Third
Degtee. Id. at pg. 13:8-19.

19. Following the legal allecution the People factually allocuted the defendant to specific

facts about the case, all of which the defendant answered, “Yes.” See Exhibit 1 at pgs. 13-15.

20. Following the allocutions, the case was adjourned to January 11, 2024, for sentencing,
where the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the New York City Department of
Corrections for the jail portion of his sentence.

21. On December 22, 2023, attorney Lawrence LaBrew contacted the assigned Assistant
District Attorney to inform him that the defendant had retained Mr. LaBrew to represent him,
and he intended to file a motion to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. On January 11, 2024,
Mr. LaBrew appeated in Part 62 with the defendant and a motion schedule was set. On February
2, 2024, Mr. LaBrew filed his motion on behalf of the defendant to withdraw the defendant’s
plea of guilty. The sole argument in the motion to withdraw is that the defendant received

ineffective assistance of counsel. The People’s response was due on February 15, 2024, and a

decision date in Part 62 was scheduled for February 29, 2024.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW

The defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea should be denied because the plea
was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and there is no legal basis to support the defendant’s

position. If the minutes of a plea show that the plea was sufficient, no further hearing is

8


## Page 9

necessary. “When a motion to withdraw a plea is patently insufficient on its face, a court may
simply deny the motion without making any inquiry,” People v. Mitchell, 21 N.Y.3d 964 (2013).
See also People v. Frederick, 45 N.Y.2d 520 (1978) (“A defendant will not be heard to challenge
his guilty plea when the minutes of the plea are unequivocal and refuse any contention of an

off-the-record promise.”).

The Defendant’s Motion Should Be Denied Because the Plea Minutes and
Record Do Not Support Defendant’s Claim that He Received Ineffective
Assistance of Counsel

A motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be denied when the record establishes that
the plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and when the court properly determines that
the defendant’s attacks on his plea lack merit. See Peopk v. Veras, 50 A.D.3d 355 (1st Dept.
2008). See also People v. Fiumefreddo, 82 N.Y.2d 536, 544 (1st Dept. 1993) (“[I]he nature and
extent of the fact-finding procedures on such motions rest largely in the discretion of the
court.”). A defendant’s attack on his assigned counsel’s performance is without merit when
they are completely unsubstantiated and refuted by the record of the plea allocution. See People
v. Henry, 30 A.D.3d 199, 200 (1st Dept. 2006).

In the context of a guilty plea, “a defendant has been afforded meaningful
teptesentation when he or she received an advantageous plea and nothing in the record casts
doubt on the apparent effectiveness of counsel. Peoph v. Ford, 86 N.Y.2d 397, 404 (1995) (cating
People v. Modica, 64 N.Y.2d 828, 829 (1985). In People v. Ford, the Court of Appeals found that
the defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when the defendant’s attorney

successfully negotiated a plea wherein the defendant pleaded guilty to only the top count in

9


## Page 10

the indictment, was not subjected to consecutive state prison time on the remaining counts,
and received an indeterminate sentence of two to six years in prison, when the maximum
sentence was 15 years in prison. See Ford, 86 N.Y.2d at 404.

While the defendant claims he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel from Richard
Southard, the holding in Ford completely belies his argument and actually proves that he, in
fact, received effective and diligent advocacy from Mr. Southard. During the plea-bargaining
process between the defense, the People, and the Court, Mr. Southard successfully negotiated
a plea where the defendant could plead guilty to a D non-violent felony with a promised
sentence of four months in jail, followed by five years of probation. The plea and terms agreed
to were completely advantageous to the defendant. Had he gone to trial, the defendant faced
a maximum indeterminate sentence of 2 1/3 to 7 years in state prison. Despite disparaging
Mr. Southard’s representation in his motion, Mr. Southard thoroughly advocated for the
defendant and negotiated a generous plea that kept the defendant out of state prison and
subject to a favorable jail/probation split sentence.

The majority of the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea focuses on his
displeasure with Mr. Southard for not obtaining the grand jury minutes, which were withheld
pursuant to a Protective Order issued by this Court on April 12, 2023. During the Protective
Order hearing, Mr. Southard argued for a full disclosure of the grand jury minutes and made
a substantial record for why the defendant should be entitled to reviewing them. Ultimately,

the Court ruled against the defense and the minutes, among other discovery, was ordered

withheld. Curiously, the defendant does not accuse his second attorney, James Nemia, a family

10


## Page 11

friend, of failing to obtain the grand jury minutes or fully investigate the case. Those charges
are only levied at Mr. Southard, who zealously advocated for the defendant in motion practice,
on the record at numerous court appearances, in conferences with the Judge and People, and
during plea bargaining.

Notably, while the defendant alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, primarily for
prior counsel failing to obtain the grand jury minutes and an overall lack of a defense
investigation, the defendant never asserted that such failure led to an uninformed or
involuntary guilty plea. Furthermore, the defendant’s assertation that he was uninformed of
the basis of the charges and had no information related to the evidence presented to the grand
juty is undermined by his own proffer at the District Attorney’s Office on July 12, 2022.
Importantly, the proffer was initiated by the defendant’s second attorney, James Nemia, who
suggested that the Assistant District Attorney meet with the defendant to, “hear his side of
the story.”

During the proffer, the defendant described the facts of the case in great detail. He
explained his role, how he recruited women, managed the websites, money, and clients, and
although he refused to say the word, admitted to being a pimp. The defendant named
numerous women who worked for him and admitted to having sexual relationships with
several of them. The defendant discussed the ‘sex dungeon’ he built in the 2°¢ Avenue
apartment and the various sexual toys and instruments used by Joseph DiMenna.

The details and facts of the investigation that were discussed in the proffer did not

come as a surprise to the defendant at all. He anticipated what was going to be discussed and

11


## Page 12

spoke coherently and in detail about all the conduct charged in the indictment. Now, after
having pled guilty and facing time on Riker’s Island, the defendant’s assertion that he was
deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not have a meaningful understanding of
the case against him is simply impossible to believe and a weak attempt to default on his
acceptance of responsibility in this case.

It is also worth mentioning that prior to hiring Lawrence LaBrew to file the instant
motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the defendant was interviewed by the Department of
Probation for the purposes of his sentencing report. In the report, the defendant gave a lengthy
statement to the probation officer, admitting his guilt. See Exhibit 2 at pg. 3. The admissions
were consistent with everything the defendant covered in the July 12, 2022 proffer. The
defendant even admitted that “there were about 12” women in total that worked for him. Id.
This is but another example of how well-informed the defendant was about the indictment
and underlying investigation. His probation interview further contradicts his claim that he
received ineffective assistance of counsel and was uninformed about the charges against him.

Richard Southard, the defendant’s third attorney, did far and away more legal advocacy
than James Nemia, who admitted to the People that he did not practice criminal law, did not

know how to file motions, and was representing the defendant because they were friends. In
contrast, Mr. Southard filed lengthy omnibus motions, argued at the Protective Order hearing,

communicated with the Court and Assistant District Attorney countless times, and effectively

negotiated a favorable plea deal for the defendant.

12


## Page 13

The defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated, under Strickland
v. Washington, is completely without merit. 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Nothing in the record supports
a finding that Mr. Southard’s representation “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.” Jd. Mr. Southard’s representation was
zealous and professional. Classifying his counsel in this case as “below an objective standard
of reasonableness” is a completely baseless characterization that totally ignores the record and
work Mr. Southard accomplished for the defendant. Further, the defendant has not provided
an iota of evidence that “there [was] a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, there result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. The
defendant provided what amounted to a full admission during the July 12, 2022 proffer. It
became abundantly clear that the defendant had no defense and could not testify differently
at trial now that he had provided a detailed admission to the People. A plea, which spared the
defendant state prison time, was the most likely outcome in this case and the defendant cannot
explain how his review of the sealed grand jury minutes would have altered that outcome or
provided him with a defense or changed the outcome at all. The defendant’s argument that
Mr. Southard was ineffective is nothing more than buyer’s remorse and an attempt to further
prolong his case, with a fourth attorney.
There is nothing in the record to suggest ineffective assistance by Richard Southard.
Furthermore, the defendant’s plea on October 12, 2023 was knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent, which is evident in the plea colloquy minutes. See Exhibit 1. The Court conducted

a detailed colloquy with the defendant where the defendant acknowledged and stated on the

13


## Page 14

record that he understood the proceedings and the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty.
The defendant stated that he had a full opportunity to discuss the matter and possible defenses
with his attorney, Mr. Southard. The record and allocution are devoid of any statement that
the defendant had concerns or questions about why he was pleading guilty, or that he was
unsatisfied or displeased with the representation by Mr. Southard.

If the allegations of ineffective assistance levied in his motion to withdraw the guilty
plea were true, the defendant had ample opportunity to express those concerns to the Court
and he would not have pleaded guilty. See People v. Mitchell, 89 A.D.3d 628 (1st Dept. 2001)
(finding defendant’s plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent and defendant’s claims of
ineffective assistance during allocution were conclusory and unsubstantiated); see a/so Peophe v.
Savinon, 52 A.D.3d 422 (1st Dept. 2008) (finding that the court properly exercised its discretion
in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea and that the record established sufficient
information upon which to conclude that his claims of ineffective assistance were without
merit). The defendant’s plea allocution indicates a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea and

the defendant’s motion to withdraw his plea should be denied.

14


## Page 15

Conclusion
The defendant’s argument that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel is without
merit and contradicted by his own statements and conduct throughout the pendency of this
case. There is nothing in the record to substantiate any of the defendant’s claims made in
support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The defendant’s plea on October 12, 2018, was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and

his Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea should be denied.

THE CLERK: Number 21 on the calendar in the
matter of Steven McEnaney, indictment 70297 of 2022.

Parties step up, give your appearances, please.

MR. SOUTHARD: On behalf of Mr. McEnaney, attorney
of record Richard Southard, S-O-U-T-H-A-R-D, 291 Broadway,
New York, New York.

Good morning, your Honor. Good morning, People.

THE COURT: Good morning.

MR. SAVINO: For the People, Keith Savino,
5 —B-V=I-N-0.

Good morning.

THE COURT: All right.

So when we conferenced the case, we had discussed

a disposition of six months city time concurrent with five

years probation.

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. I did
speak to defense counsel today and I would extend a
one-time recommendation of a three-month split with an
allocution by the People and a Waiver of Appeal, given some
personal matters for the defendant that defense counsel
brought up today.

THE COURT: And how long do you propose the
sentence be deferred? Sorry, what -- it was noisy. What's
the last part of your recommendation, repeat it please.

MR. SAVINO: It would be three months jail,

five-year probation split, a Waiver of Appeal, and then an
allocution from the People.

THE COURT: All right. And tell me on the record
why you think that such a low disposition or low
recommendation is appropriate.

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

I think what differed from when we had our
conference a few weeks ago, what I'm taking into
consideration now is if we could have a disposition today
and avoid having multiple victims come in and testify in
court, which they are more than willing to do, but to spare
them having to come in, discuss their personal lives,
discuss the facts of these cases and be subject to
cross-examination, if we can have a disposition today, I
would be comfortable with the proposed disposition.

THE COURT: Okay. And with respect to any of the
allegations involving violence, is it true that they --
those individual acts are beyond the Statute of
Limitations?

MR. SAVINO: That's correct, your Honor. We have

investigated those extensively, and anything involving

violence from clients of the enterprise would have been
outside the Statute of Limitations.

THE COURT: And you said the witnesses are willing

to come in?

case today.

MR. SOUTHARD: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: He is. All right.

So, please give me a COpy of the indictment, Mr.

Savino.

MR. SAVINO: And, Judge, I have already received

the signed Waiver of Appeal .

THE COURT: All right.

MR. SAVINO: And I have a copy for the Court.

THE COURT: Then at this time, counsel, does your

client wish to withdraw his previously entered plea of not

guilty, and enter a plea of guilty to the sole count in the

indictment of promoting prostitution in the third degree in

exchange for a promised sentence of four months jail

concurrent with five years probation split, subject to a

Waiver of Appeal and the specific allocution proposed by

the People?

MR. SOUTHARD: He does, your Honor.

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: State your full name for the record,

I will be asking you a series of questions. If at any time

you don't understand me, let me know, and if you need to

do that, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, for the record, is Mr. Richard
Southard who is seated next to you your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have you had enough time to fully
discuss your plea and sentence with your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Are you satisfied with the

THE COURT: Has anyone forced or threatened you to

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: Are you on any drugs, medication or
alcohol today?

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: So you fully understand what is
happening here, correct?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: When you plead guilty, you give up
certain valuable constitutional rights including but not

limited to the right to remain silent, the right toa

trial, the right to confront the witnesses who testify

against you at trial, to require the People to prove your
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, to testify on your own
behalf and call witnesses on your own behalf, if that's
what you choose to do, as well as the right to contest any
search or seizure which may have occurred in this case. Do
you willingly and voluntarily give up each of those
valuable rights?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And, People, is there a Certificate of
Compliance in the case?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, Judge.

THE COURT: So there is no need for a waiver of

MR. SAVINO: No.

THE COURT: Additionally, as part of your plea
agreement you are giving up your generalized right of
appeal, being asked to sign a written waiver. Have you
gone over the written waiver line by line with your
attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Have any questions you may have had
been answered to your satisfaction by your attorney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You understand that what you're giving

up is your generalized right of appeal which means that

ordinarily had you chosen to go to trial and been
convicted, you could contest on appeal any mistakes that
you felt were made during the course of the trial ona
case. By signing the waiver, you give up that right, do
you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: You also give up the right to contest
on appeal that the sentence imposed is excessive or that
the People have failed to meet their statutory speedy trial
obligation, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE DEFENDANT: No.

THE COURT: All right. Is there an agreement or a
request that he remain out pending the imposition of his
sentence?

MR. SAVINO: Yes, that's right.

THE COURT: And what is the specific request for
an adjournment for remaining out, and is there any request
for a specific sentence date?

MR. SOUTHARD: Well, I understand that the normal
period for an out I and S would be six weeks. I would ask
that you extend that period to beyond the Christmas
holiday.

Mr. McEnaney has custody of his son, and he also
runs a volunteer animal sanctuary where he has over 120
animals and he needs time to place as many of those animals
as he can during the next couple of months before he turns
himself in.

Proceedings ill

MR. SOUTHARD: That's fine, Judge.

THE COURT: All right. Was there an Order of

Protection in this case?

MR. SAVINO: No.
THE COURT: All right. So you must be interviewed
by the Department of Probation, and you must answer all of

their questions completely and truthfully. After admitting

your guilt to the very specific allocution here today, and
fully admitting your guilt as to the one charge that you

are pleading to, you cannot turn around to the Department

of Probation and deny your guilt, say you did nothing wrong

or that you're innocent, do you understand that?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Because if you do that, you will be

bound by the plea that is being entered here today, but I
will not be bound to impose the promised sentence, and I
could theoretically sentence you to a term of up to two and

a third to seven years state prison, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. In addition to cooperating
with the Department of Probation, you must have no new
arrests between today's date and the date that we select

for sentencing, and you must show up on the date that we

have selected for your sentence, that is January 1l. If

you violate either one of those conditions, again you will

be bound by your plea, but I will not be bound to impose
the promised sentence, and I could sentence you to that

maximum that we just discussed, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: And furthermore, if you fail to appear
on the date of your sentence, I can impose that sentence
even though you're not physically present, understood?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: "That sentence" meaning two and a

third to seven, all right?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right.

Now, in the future, if you commit another felony
and are convicted under New York State Law you may be

deemed a predicate felon which means upon conviction of

that second felony you will be facing substantial and

mandatory state prison time, and substantial and mandatory

post-release supervision, do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: And if you are not a United States

citizen, upon your plea to this charge you will be deported

or suffer some other significant immigration consequence,

do you understand?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: Mr. Southard, have you had a

Proceedings 13

discussion with your client as to whether there are any
potential immigration consequences?

MR. SOUTHARD: I have, your Honor.

THE COURT: And understanding you're not a United
States citizen, such consequences exist, do you still wish
to plead guilty, Mr. McEnaney?

THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

THE COURT: All right. So you're pleading guilty
to the charge of promoting prostitution in the third degree
committed as follows:

That during the period from on or about May 1,
2012 to on or about January 19, 2018, in New York County,
you knowingly advanced and profited by prostitution by

believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the
