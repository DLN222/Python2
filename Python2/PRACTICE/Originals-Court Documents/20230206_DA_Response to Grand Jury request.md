THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AFFIRMATION IN
RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT’S

OMNIBUS MOTION

-against-
STEVEN MCENANEY,

IND-70297-22
Defendant.

Keith Savino, an attorney admitted to practice before the Courts of this State, affirms
under penalty of perjury that:
1. Iam the Assistant District Attorney in New York County assigned to this case and

am familiar with its facts.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
MOTION TO INSPECT THE GRAND JURY
MINUTES AND TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT
3. The People consent to the Court’s in camera review of the grand jury minutes. A
copy of the grand jury minutes has been provided to the court on February 6, 2023 for in

camera review. Inspection will reveal that the evidence before the grand jury amply supports

the offense(s) charged, that the grand jury was properly instructed on the law, and that the


## Page 3

integrity of the proceedings was unimpaired. The People deny all allegations to the contrary
and oppose disclosure all non-testimonial portions of the instruction portions of the grand
jury minutes to the defense. The issues raised in the defendant’s motion are straightforward,
and disclosure is not necessary to their resolution. CPL §210.30(3).

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT?’S
REQUEST FOR A BILL OF PARTICULARS

4. The facts set forth in the indictment, the discovery provided pursuant to CPL Article
245, and the Automatic Discovery Form ("ADF"), which was previously served upon
defendant, provide all the particulars to which the defendant is entitled. See CPL §200.95.
They specify “the substance of defendant’s conduct ... which the People intend to prove at
trial on their direct case ....” The other information requested is evidentiary detail beyond
the scope of a bill of particulars. See, People v Davis, 41 NY2d 678, 680 (1977) (“{a] bill of

particulars serves to clarify the pleading; it is not a discovery device’). Accordingly,

defendant’s motion for further particulars should be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DISCOVERY

5. The People have provided all the discovery to which the defendant is entitled under
Article 245. The additional items that the defendant seeks are not in the People’s possession,
custody or control, or persons under the People’s direction or control. The People are aware
of our obligation, under CPL § 245.20(2) to “make a diligent good faith effort to ascertain
the existence of material or information discoverable under CPL § 245.20(1) where it exists
but is not within’ our control, and will provide such discovery under the timelines

established in CPL § 245.20(1).

6. The defendant requests exculpatory material within the meaning of Brady v Maryland,
373 US 83 (1963). The People are aware of their continuing duty under Brady and CPL §
245.20(1)(k) to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense and will continue to honor that
obligation.

PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S

MOTION TO SUPPRESS DEFENDANT’S
STATEMENTS

7. The People do not intend to offer in their direct case at trial statements that the
defendant made to a law enforcement officer. A Huntley hearing is therefore unnecessary.

MOTION TO SUPPRESS IDENTIFICATION

8. The People do not intend to introduce at trial testimony of any witness who

from 2012 through 2018. The People submit that this evidence was lawfully obtained and
deny all allegations to the contrary.

10. On March 3, 2022, New York Supreme Court Justice Melissa Jackson authorized the
search wattant to search the defendant’s residence in Salt Point, New York. The defendant
alleges that the search warrant executed during the investigation of this case was issued
without reasonable cause. Examination of the warrant affidavit, which is provided for the
Court’s review, belies that claim. The warrant application provides reliable facts and
circumstances that are collectively of such weight and persuasiveness as to convince a
prudent person that it was reasonably likely that the evidence sought would be found at the
designated location. CPL §§690.10, 70.10(2).

11. The defendant alleges that the search warrant was overbroad and based on stale,

unreliable information. The watrant application is based on sound, detailed accounting from

residence would contain evidence of his prostitution enterprise, which dated back to 2012

residence during the period charged in the indictment. Importantly, the items detailed in the
or otherwise expose the complainant to when complainant visited the defendant’s home.

13. The warrant application was based on probable cause and accordingly, the

defendant’s motion to controvert and suppression of the physical evidence recovered should

be denied.
PEOPLE’S RESPONSE TO THE
DEFENDANT?’S REQUEST FOR A SANDOVAL
HEARING
14. The People respectfully request that this matter be deferred for consideration by the

trial judge. Within 15 days of trial, the People will provide notice of prior uncharged

criminal, vicious, or immoral acts that the prosecutor intends to use at trial to impeach the
credibility of the defendant. CPL § 245.20(1)(6).
‘ PEOPLE’S REQUEST FOR RECIPROCAL

15. Pursuant to CPL §250.20, the People hereby demand that the defendant supply (a)
the place or places where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the commission

of the crime, and (b) the names, residential addresses, places of employment and addresses
