I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all

the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the

such | . oe ge

2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of

## Page 4

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

any events which form the basis for these charges;

trial, or which the People intend to introduce at trial;

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of

the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the


## Page 17

quests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's

ord, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of

such | . oe ge
ch information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence

prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attomey supplies the

or imm
oral conduct sought to be used for purposes of cross examination pursuant

before asking for preclusion of specific crimes or acts.
2. Pursuant to CPL 160.40, defendant requests that the Court provide defendant with a copy of

## Page 4

I. BILL OF PARTICULARS

The defense requests the court direct the People to respond to those items refused by the People, if
any, in their response to the Bill of Particulars included in defendant’s Demand for Discovery.
Defendant cannot adequately prepare for pre-trial hearings and trial without this information which I
believe is within the control and knowledge of the District Attorney of New York County and that

same may not be obtained by any other source.
II. © DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION

To the extent not previously disclosed, pursuant to CPL 240.40 the defendant requests that the
Court direct the People to provide the defendant with the following property which is or with the
exercise of due diligence could come, within the possession or control of the prosecutor on the ground
that such discovery is material to the preparation of the defense and that the requests herein are
reasonable. If the Court should refuse to permit defendant’s Motion for Discovery for any material
requested herein, defense counsel requests that copies of such documents be placed in a sealed

envelope and attached to the Court’s file for purposes of any subsequent appeal:

1. Any written, recorded or oral or observed statement of the defendant (and of any co-defendant or
co-conspirator, whether charged or not, including any alleged escorts or prostitutes interviewed by the
District Attorney’s Office in connection with this investigation), including all notes, summaries, or
memoranda concerning such statements made by any law enforcement agent or by any person acting
under the direction of, or in cooperation with any law enforcement agent. Also, state whether the
defendant and or co-conspirator was advised of his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), the name of the officer who advised the defendant of his rights and the date, time and

case; and whether any search warrants were applied for, granted or denied and any inventory of said

trial, or which the People intend to introduce at trial;

to prospective witnesses or made with the participation of any witness (including the names of all
persons participating in the preparation of such sketches or compositions, the names and addresses of
all persons to whom the photographs or drawings were exhibited, as well as any documents that reflect
the date, time, circumstances and result of such exhibition including any questions asked or statements

made at any such preparation or exhibition);

11. Any photograph, photocopy, or other reproduction made by or at the direction of a police
officer, peace officer or prosecutor of any property prior to its release pursuant to the provisions of
Penal Law §450.10, regardless of whether the People intend to introduce at trial the property, or the
photograph, photocopy or other reproduction, including booking photographs; and photographs of
scratch marks and abrasions to defendant’s back, torso, arms and hands taken at the time of defendant’s

filing of a complaint against the complaining witness, which preceded his arrest.

12. Any audio or video tapes or other electronic recordings made of the defendant by police

officials, including the name of the person who made the recording;

13. Any tapes or other electronic recordings that the prosecutor intends to introduce at trial

but not limited to video pertaining to defendant’s arrest.

14. Copies of all documents, police reports, notes, or memoranda, prepared or maintained by police
officials containing information relating to this investigation including but not limited to:

a. copies of all search and/or arrest warrants, together with all supporting affidavits and any other
documents in support of any warrant that resulted in the arrest of the defendant or the seizure of any
property in this case;

b. any documents reflecting by whom, the exact date, time, location and manner in which the events
underlying the charged offense were reported to the police, including handwritten and typed arrest
reports, UF61 or other complaint reports, pre-arraignment forms, aided reports, supervisor’s reports,
Unusual Occurrence Reports, Evidence Collection Unit Reports, Stop and Frisk Reports, OLBS
Worksheets, Police Service Request cards, complaint follow-ups, Stop and Frisk Reports, on-line

not;

h. diagrams, charts or other intended to be used at trial by prosecution witnesses or by the

docket number of the case in which the expert testified, as well as copies of any transcripts of that
testimony.

18. Disclosure of the criminal record of the defendant within the possession or control of the

prosecution;

19. CPL 240.20(2) specifically requires disclosure of the items requested above relating to scientific
or physical examination or tests. The People can articulate no prejudice to them in allowing the
defense adequate discovery of scientific data and procedures. Any refusal to provide such information
can only be for the purpose of retaining some perceived tactical advantage, at the expense of the

defense.

20. The items requested are in the exclusive possession, custody, and control of the government and
the defendant has no other means of ascertaining the disclosures requested. The items requested are not
privileged. The items and information are material to this cause and the issues of guilt or innocence
and punishment to be determined in this cause, if any. The defendant will not properly be prepared to

go to trial without such information and inspection, nor can the defendant adequately prepare a defense


## Page 9

to the charges against him without it. Absent such discovery the defendant’s rights under the

Constitution will be violated to his irreparable injury and thus deprive the accused of a fair trial herein.

21. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, People v. Betts, 70 N.Y.2d 289, 520 N.Y.S.2d 370, 514 N.E.2d 865
(1987), and People v. Ventimiglia, 52 N.Y.2d 350, 438 N.Y.S.2d 261, 420 N.E.2d 59 (1981), the
defendant requests that the People deliver to the undersigned complete information concerning all
specific instances of the defendant's prior uncharged criminal, vicious, or immoral conduct that the
People intend introduce as direct evidence at trial, or upon cross examination, to impeach the
credibility of the defendant, should he choose to testify at trial. Pursuant to CPL 240.43, the defense
requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide this information within three days, excluding

Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of jury selection.

22. To the extent that the prosecution introduces evidence of uncharged crimes in its direct case, the
defense requests that it be provided with all Rosario material of the witness relating to such uncharged

crimes. People v. Lineszy, 212 A.D.2d 548, 622 N.Y.S.2d 325 (2d Dep't 1995).

23. Defendant also requests that the Court order the prosecution to provide any discovery to which
the defendant is entitled pursuant to People v. Rosario, 9 N.Y.2d 286, 213 N.Y.S.2d 448, 173 N.E.2d
881, 7 A.L.R.3d 174 (1961), and CPL 240.45 to the defendant within three days, excluding Saturdays,

Sundays and holidays, prior to the commencement of any hearing and/or trial relating to this matter.

24. The defendant requests disclosure of any other information required to be disclosed by the

People pursuant to the New York or United States Constitutions.

participation in dangerous, vicious, immoral or criminal behavior on the part of the victim, and/or any
persons intended to be called as witnesses by the prosecutor, including but not limited to "rap sheets",

436 (4th Dep't 1996); People v. Pressley, 91 N.Y.2d 825, 652 N.Y.S.2d 436, 689 N.E.2d 525(1997).

witness's testimony;

h. Any threats, express or implied, direct or indirect, made to any prosecution witness and
unindicted co-conspirators, including criminal prosecution or investigation, any change in the

perceived influence;

i. Complete information of each occasion when each witness who was or is an informer,
accomplice, or co-conspirator has testified before any court or grand jury, including date, caption, and
indictment number of the case;

matter;

m. Any information to the effect that all or some of the evidence that may be utilized by the People

at trial was illegally or improperly obtained or was obtained even partially as the result of the improper

the existence of which is known to the District Attorney, or which by due diligence may become
known to the District Attorney, which may be, or may tend to be favorable or exculpatory to the
defendant, and which is or may be material to the issue of guilt or punishment.

IV. PRECLUSION OF STATEMENT EVIDENCE.

1. Defendant has not received notice of any statements alleged to have been made by defendant
served within the statutorily prescribed fifteen (15) days, therefore should any newly alleged
statements be alleged for which the defendant has not received notice, they must be precluded for lack

of notice. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643 N.E.2d 501 (1994);
People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

V. PRECLUSION OF IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

1. Defendant did not receive notice of any police arranged identification procedures pursuant to CPL
710.30(1)(b); therefore, Defendant moves for preclusion for lack of notice of any non-noticed

identification procedures. CPL 710.30; see People v. Lopez, 84 N.Y.2d 425, 618 N.Y.S.2d 879, 643

N.E.2d 501 (1994); People v. O'Doherty, 70 N.Y.2d 479, 522 N.Y.S.2d 498, 517 N.E.2d 213 (1987).

VI. MOTION TO CONTROVERT SEARCH WARRANT AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE
RECOVERED

1. For an Order pursuant to C.P.L. §§ 710.20 and 690.10 directing that any and all


## Page 12

evidence and property recovered pursuant to a search warrant executed at 22 Molly’s Way, Salt Point
NY 12578 (the target location) be suppressed on the grounds set forth herein or in the alternative to

grant a hearing to determine the same and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just and

proper.

2. Pursuant to CPL 710.20, the defendant moves that all evidence seized or discovered as a result

of the search of the target location be suppressed, since, upon information and belief, the warrant was

issued without probable cause for the following reasons:

3. | No search warrant may be issued unless it is supported by probable cause to believe that

an offense has been committed or that evidence of criminality may be found in a certain
location. People v. Bigelow, 66 NY2d 417(1985). People v. Pinchback, 82 NY2d 857 (1993). In
addition, probable cause can be based only on facts made known to the issuing judge at the time
the search warrant application was decided. People v. Nieves, 36 NY2d 396 (1975). People v.

Asaro, 34 AD2d 968 (1970). Based upon the redacted search warrant application provided to the

defendant, the search was based upon imprecise, stale and unreliable information and was not

supported by probable cause. Moreover, the warrant was overbroad.

a, The defendant has standing to contest the legality of the search warrant issued in this matter as he

has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his residence.

the target location being defendant’s residence there is no evidence provided by any informant or


## Page 13

investigator that the target location was used in connection with any criminality; or that any evidence

of criminality would be there; to the contrary, Complainant -1 indicates explicit photos were taken at a
different location. Complainant-1 also alleges giving money to defendant, there is no evidence that she
gave him money in the target location or even that she was ever inside the target location. In fact any
money claimed to be electronically sent, can be corroborated via bank records without intrusion into
Defendant’s home. Complainant-1 refers to a “work apartment” which might yield evidence but this is
a distinct location from the target location. The Complainant-1 also references packages being shipped
to addresses belonging to a Joe Dimenna: 10 E. 67 St and 3 Halsey Path. but other than using Amazon
packages to establish the defendant's residence; there is no proof whatsoever establishing that evidence
would be located there. No witnesses observed defendant conducting any criminal business at the
target location nor did any witness observe evidence there. The analogy would be the police searching
a drug dealer’s residence months after observing him conduct a street sale at a different location. In
order to search the dealer’s residence months later, they would need the drug seller’s consent or an
informing witness testifying they recently saw contraband/evidence at the residence? Complainant
spoke of hidden cameras at the “work apartment”, not the target location, which the investigator
concludes based on pure conjecture, that the defendant would have preserved these recordings. This is
complete speculation on the part of the investigator. There is no evidence to substantiate that any
recordings of any kind were saved, much less that they would be at the target location. It is equally as
likely that the surveillance equipment re-recorded over itself, as most security cameras do. The
investigator also concluded that the target location would be the “likely location” for these recordings
without any proof that the recordings were saved or any reliable information that they weren’t in a

safety deposit box, or hidden at the work apartment or some other location not overtly linked to the
defendant.


## Page 14

c. The warrant under which the property was seized was overly broad with regard to the property
authorized to be seized; Given the lack of any reliable information that evidence was located at the
target premises; the search warrant was drafted in the broadest possible terms listing every possible
electronic data, storage and communication device. On the bottom of Page 3, it describes: Any and all
data, information, or images evidencing internet usage history for the time period January 1, 2012 to
present (emphasis added). This is more than ten years prior to the application for the warrant and it’s

likely that any crimes from that time period would be beyond the Statute of Limitations. The scope of

the warrant was overbroad covering over a ten year period..

d. The information provided by the informant was stale and therefore could not be the basis for
establishing probable cause. Generally speaking, a court must be satisfied that the information in an
application for a search warrant must be sufficiently current so as to establish that the property sought
is presently at the designated location. People v. Loewel, 50 AD2d 483 (1977). There is no set time
limit fixed by the courts to determine whether or not the information is stale. People v. Mendez, 199
AD2d 182 (1993). However, in People v. Edwards 69 NY2d 814 (1987), the Court of Appeals found
that information in an application for a search warrant was stale where ten days had passed between
the events that established probable cause and the issuance of the warrant. Complainant-1 provided
information in the Fall and Winter of 2021 of prior relationship with defendant and February of 2022;
it is my belief that Complainant had no continued relationship with defendant after Fall of 2021 and
that information provided was relating to events that occurred 6 months prior and in most instances,
longer than that. This is also supported by the investigator’s prior warrants of email accounts which
date back to April and July of 2019, almost three full years before a warrant was sought for the target

location. Unfortunately, some key dates have been redacted out but in the unredacted sections, there is


## Page 15

not any credible evidence provided in the search warrant affidavit that indicates that even if there was

evidence of a crime in 2019 or before Fall 2021 that it would still be there at the time of this search

warrant application. This warrant application was nothing more than a fishing expedition.

Consequently, all evidence obtained as a result of the exploitation of an unlawful warrant must be
suppressed as “tainted fruit” of the Constitutional violation. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471
(1963). The defendant therefore moves, pursuant to CPL 710.20 to suppress all evidence seized from
the target location. The defendant requests this motion to suppress be granted summarily pursuant to

CPL 710.60(2) or in the alternative, Defendant requests a Mapp hearing to determine the lawfulness of

the arrest and seizure of property.

VII. MOTION TO INSPECT GRAND JURY MINUTES

1. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(2), the defendant requests an examination by the Court and defense
counsel of the stenographic minutes of the Grand Jury proceeding, including the District Attorney’s

charge and instructions on the law, for the purpose of deciding the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss

and/or reduce the Indictment, infra.

2. Pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), the defendant requests that the Court order a release of those
portions of the Grand Jury minutes that are relevant to the determination of defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss, infra, so that defense counsel may effectively present written and/or oral argument in support

thereof. As of the writing of this motion, they have not been turned over.

VIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT PURSUANT TO CPL 210.20, CPL 210.30
AND CPL 210.35

1. The defendant moves that the indictment against him be dismissed pursuant to CPL article 210


## Page 16

based on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the

offense(s) charged, or any lesser included offense, to wit:

Since Defendant has no access to the transcripts of the proceedings or charging instructions, in
the Grand Jury, defense requests that the Court inspect the grand jury minutes that form the basis for
the indictment in this case and that the Court disclose the minutes inspected and the grand jury

testimony to defense counsel, pursuant to CPL 210.30(3), so that I might more effectively represent the

accused on this motion to dismiss.

3. I respectfully request to be advised by cover letter from the prosecutor or from the court's office

as to the date when the grand jury minutes are provided to the court.

4. Defendant requests that the Court examine the legal instructions to the grand jury. The defendant
further requests that the instructions to the grand jury be disclosed to defense counsel so that the
accuracy and sufficiency of the prosecutor's instructions to the grand jury might be evaluated and so
that any appropriate motions might be made by the defense.

5. In addition, defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed based on the factual basis and legal
authority set forth below, namely:

a. The arrest of the defendant was wholly without probable cause.

b. The grand jury proceeding was defective within the meaning of CPL 210.35.

c. The statute defining the offense charged is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.

IX. MOTION TO PRECLUDE PURSUANT TO PEOPLE V. SANDOVAL AND UNCHARGED
ACTS

1. Pursuant to People v. Sandoval, 34 N.Y.2d 371, 357 N.Y.S.2d 849, 314 N.E.2d 413 (1974), the


## Page 17

defendant re
quests that the People be precluded from asking any questions concerning defendant's
arrest Tec ict i0T 1
ord, conviction record, or any prior immoral, vicious, or other bad acts. The presentation of

such | . oe ge
ch information to the jury in this case would greatly prejudice the defendant, far outweighing any
probative value such information might have. The defendant requests a hearing as to any such evidence

deo . . .
prosecution seeks to introduce at trial. The defense will wait until the District Attomey supplies the

or imm
